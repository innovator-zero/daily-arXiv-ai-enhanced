This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation."}

In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction."}

This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility."}

Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires."}

As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively."}

This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete."}

However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments."}

We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems."}

While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines."}

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation.

However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions."}

This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design."}

Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms."}

In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding.

We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models.

After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process."}

We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares.

We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques."}

Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets."}

The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors.

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly."}

Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \\textbf{E}lastic \\textbf{T}rust \\textbf{R}egions (\\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration."}

To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area."}

To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after.

Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards."}

Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well."}

LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples.

In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B.

However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring \"vision\" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning."}

Black", "Omid Taheri"], "title": "FUSION: Full-Body Unified Motion Prior for Body and Hands via Diffusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public."}

We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules.

Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only \"non-shared\" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate \"shared\" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem."}

Murat Tekalp"], "title": "Padé Neurons for Efficient Neural Models", "comment": "Accepted for Publication in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING; 13 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon."}

The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems."}

While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis."}

However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders."}

In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions.

New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures."}

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment."}

This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity.

The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms.

Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents."}

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG."}

Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC."}

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection."}

Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments."}

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards."}

MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset."}

However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms."}
