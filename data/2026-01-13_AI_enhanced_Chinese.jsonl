I explore HyperTopo-Adapters, a lightweight, parameter-efficient head trained on top of a frozen vision encoder, which embeds features on a product manifold -- hyperbolic + Euclidean + spherical (H + E + S) -- to encourage hierarchical separation (H), local linear detail (E), and global closure (S). A topology prior complements Dice/BCE in two forms: (i) persistent-homology (PH) distance for evaluation and selection, and (ii) a differentiable surrogate that combines a soft Euler-characteristic match with total variation regularization for stable training. I introduce warm-ups for both the hyperbolic contrastive term and the topology prior, per-sample evaluation of structure-aware metrics (Boundary-F1, Betti errors, PD distance), and a min-PD within top-K Dice rule for checkpoint selection. On a Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940), early results show consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while Dice/IoU remain competitive. The study is diagnostic by design: I report controlled ablations (curvature learning, latent dimensions, contrastive temperature, surrogate settings), and ongoing tests varying encoder strength (ResNet-50, DeepLabV3, DINOv2/v3), input resolution, PH weight, and partial unfreezing of late blocks.

Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient.

To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL.

Classical optimization and control pipelines handle these constraints well but depend on highly accurate mathematical representations of terrain geometry, making them prone to error when perception is noisy or incomplete. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning has shown strong resilience to disturbances and modeling errors, yet end-to-end policies rarely discover the precise foothold placement and step sequencing required for discontinuous terrain. These contrasting limitations motivate approaches that guide learning with physics-based structure rather than relying purely on reward shaping. In this work, we introduce a locomotion framework in which a reduced-order stepping planner supplies dynamically consistent motion targets that steer the RL training process via Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) rewards. This combination of structured footstep planning and data-driven adaptation produces accurate, agile, and hardware-validated stepping-stone locomotion on a humanoid robot, substantially improving reliability compared to conventional model-free reinforcement-learning baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cc\u8db3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CLF\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u7acb\u8db3\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u8e0f\u811a\u77f3\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u800c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7acb\u8db3\u70b9\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u6b65\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CLF\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfcRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u654f\u6377\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8e0f\u811a\u77f3\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u53d7\u9650\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u53cc\u8db3\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively \"whitens\" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this \"Axioms-as-Layers\" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6FIA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6982\u5ff5\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6982\u5ff5\u654f\u611f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "FIA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6982\u5ff5\u663e\u8457\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u8fde\u63a5\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bc6\u522b\u6982\u5ff5\u654f\u611f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6982\u5ff5\u65e0\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFIA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FIA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u5c11\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments. This will serve as a foundation to include the relations of functional and actionable elements, which then can be used for dynamic simulation and reasoning. Key results of this research include both quantitative results of the generated semantic labels as well as qualitative results of the scene graph, especially in hindsight of pipe structures and identified functional relations.

Evaluating 39 VLMs, we find that even state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve under 50% on the original queries. Crucially, query explicitation alone yields 8 to 22 point improvements, with smaller models benefiting most. We further show that even with web search, under-specified queries underperform explicit queries without search, revealing that current retrieval cannot compensate for what users leave unsaid.

The task remains challenging because interactions between the knife and deformable materials are highly nonlinear and often entail large deformations, frequent contact, and topological change, which in turn hinder stable and safe large-scale data collection.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that couples a vision-language-action (VLA) dataset with a physically realistic cutting simulator built on the material point method (MPM). Our simulator adopts MLS-MPM as its computational core, reducing numerical dissipation and energy drift while preserving rotational and shear responses even under topology-changing cuts. During cutting, forces and stress distributions are estimated from impulse exchanges between particles and the grid, enabling stable tracking of transient contact forces and energy transfer.\n  We also provide a benchmark dataset that integrates diverse cutting trajectories, multi-view visual observations, and fine-grained language instructions, together with force--torque and tool--pose labels to provide physically consistent training signals.\n  These components realize a learning--evaluation loop that respects the core physics of cutting and establishes a safe, reproducible, and scalable foundation for advancing VLA models in deformable object manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u98df\u54c1\u5207\u5272\u8fd9\u4e00\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5207\u5272\u529b\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u98df\u54c1\u5207\u5272\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5200\u5177\u4e0e\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6750\u6599\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MLS-MPM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u529b\u548c\u5e94\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5207\u5272\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0a\u91cd\u5207\u5272\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u5b66\u4e60-\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u98df\u54c1\u5207\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Existing 4DMRI produces acceptable artifacts of averaged breathing phases, which can blur and misrepresent instantaneous dynamic information. Recovery of such information requires a new paradigm to reconstruct extremely undersampled non-Cartesian k-space data. We propose B-FIRE, a binning-free diffusion implicit neural representation framework for hyper-accelerated MR reconstruction capable of reflecting instantaneous 3D abdominal anatomy. B-FIRE employs a CNN-INR encoder-decoder backbone optimized using diffusion with a comprehensive loss that enforces image-domain fidelity and frequency-aware constraints. Motion binned image pairs were used as training references, while inference was performed on binning-free undersampled data.

Key advancements are the complex positioning system that combines 2D localization using a single motion tracking camera with onboard LiDAR for precise positioning, and a novel flight control algorithm, which works differently along the trajectory and normally to it, ensuring smoothness and high precision of the drawings at the same time. A 100 square meters mural was created using the developed multi-drone system, validating the system's efficacy.

Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.\n  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.\n  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u5148\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7531\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u9012\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u7acb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5d29\u6e83\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5373\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u7f29\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u660e\u786e\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u79ef\u7d2f\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the latent organization of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three complementary dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry.

Starting from clean checkpoints of Qwen2.5 (0.5B/1.5B) and Gemma3 (1B/4B), we inject five copies of GSM8K and MBPP test items into the first 2B tokens of an otherwise 25B token extended pre-training dataset. We then compare the contaminated and clean models both immediately after pre-training and again after two popular post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). The applied post-training steps do not have any contamination. Across math and coding benchmarks, we find three consistent patterns: (i) Contamination causes performance spikes that are gradually diminished with continued pre-training. After even 25B tokens the apparent performance inflation of contamination can become close to zero. (ii) Both SFT and GRPO resurface the leaked information, but with different external validity: SFT inflates scores only on the contaminated tasks, whereas GRPO also inflates performance on uncontaminated counterparts (GSMPlus, HumanEval). (iii) Model scale amplifies these tendencies, larger Supervised Fine Tuned models memorize more, while larger GRPO models translate leakage into more generalizable capabilities.

To address these challenges effectively, we propose TBDN, a training-free framework integrating two complementary closed-loop mechanisms: Hint Instruction (HI) and Query Contrastive Decoding (QCD). HI injects task-aware inductive bias via lightweight prompt engineering to anchor models on contextual mapping rules, thereby mitigating compliance failure. QCD adjusts the decoding distributions of language models by contrasting full-input and query-omitted distributions, suppressing prior-dominated hallucination. TBDN achieves State-of-the-Art performance on CoBSAT and Text-to-Image Fast Mini-ImageNet, with robust generalization across model backbones, prompt designs, and hyperparameters.

Alharbi", "Shinkyu Park"], "title": "UMLoc: Uncertainty-Aware Map-Constrained Inertial Localization with Quantified Bounds", "comment": null, "summary": "Inertial localization is particularly valuable in GPS-denied environments such as indoors. However, localization using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) suffers from drift caused by motion-process noise and sensor biases. This paper introduces Uncertainty-aware Map-constrained Inertial Localization (UMLoc), an end-to-end framework that jointly models IMU uncertainty and map constraints to achieve drift-resilient positioning. UMLoc integrates two coupled modules: (1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) quantile regressor, which estimates the specific quantiles needed to define 68%, 90%, and 95% prediction intervals serving as a measure of localization uncertainty and (2) a Conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with cross-attention that fuses IMU dynamic data with distance-based floor-plan maps to generate geometrically feasible trajectories.

We integrated historical fire events from NASA FIRMS, daily meteorological observations from Meteostat, and vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Google Earth Engine for the period 2015-2023. After harmonizing the datasets using spatial and temporal joins, we evaluated several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and an ensemble classifier.

Existing solutions typically resort to a heavy \"data engineering\" paradigm-synthesizing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This pipeline primarily optimizes probability sampling efficiency and aligns output distributions, but fails to activate the intrinsic intelligence required for dynamic visual exploration. In this work, we propose TIR-Flow, a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from passive processing to active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updating. Concretely, our framework operates through three synergistic modules: HDD decomposes complex queries into a set of verifiable sub-tasks; HAP actively directs visual attention to gather high-resolution evidence for hypothesis validation; EBA maintains a persistent workspace to accumulate and update the discovered clues for logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines, delivering an average performance boost of 5.9%, with gains reaching 10.5% on Egoschema.

In TLM, a laser beam is used to cut target tissue, while forceps are employed to grasp, manipulate, and stabilize tissue within the UADT. Although TLM systems may rely on different technologies and interfaces, forceps manipulation is still predominantly performed manually, introducing limitations in ergonomics, precision, and controllability. This paper proposes a novel robotic system for tissue manipulation in UADT procedures, based on a novel end-effector designed for forceps control. The system is integrated within a teleoperation framework that employs a robotic manipulator with a programmed remote center of motion (RCM), enabling precise and constrained instrument motion while improving surgeon ergonomics.

Results show strong alignment between the Judge Model and human scores, demonstrating its potential as a scalable, interpretable evaluation pipeline for future multimodal AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u79cd\u5b50\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5224\u65ad\u805a\u5408\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728280\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We propose a novel semantic navigation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer patterns from partial observations and predict regions where the goal is most likely located. Our method combines local perceptual inputs with frontier-based exploration and periodic LLM queries, which extract symbolic patterns (e.g., room numbering schemes and building layout structures) and update a confidence grid used to guide exploration. This enables robots to move efficiently toward goal locations labeled with textual identifiers (e.g., \"room 8\") even before direct observation. We demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient navigation in sparse, partially observable grid environments by exploiting symbolic patterns. Experiments across environments modeled after real floor plans show that our approach consistently achieves near-optimal paths and outperforms baselines by over 25% in Success weighted by Path Length.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u524d\u6cbf\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u964c\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u6807\u5fd7\u3001\u623f\u95f4\u53f7\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9a\u671f\u8fdb\u884cLLM\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u623f\u95f4\u7f16\u53f7\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5efa\u7b51\u5e03\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\uff08SPL\uff09\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d85\u8fc725%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u671d\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are widely used for interpretation. However, existing time-series variants typically treat the feature and time axes independently, fragmenting structural signals formed jointly by multiple variables over specific intervals. We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets. A financial case study shows that GS-SHAP identifies interpretable multivariate-temporal interactions among key market variables during high-volatility regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GS-SHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u6bb5\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217SHAP\u53d8\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u8f74\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u5171\u540c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u7ec4\u6bb5\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7Shapley\u5f52\u56e0\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u9886\u57df\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u533b\u7597\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cGS-SHAP\u5728\u5220\u9664\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08DeltaAUC\uff09\u4e0a\u6bd4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217SHAP\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea61.7\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5339\u914d\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea640%\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u91d1\u878d\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aGS-SHAP\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u5e02\u573a\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u53d8\u91cf-\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "GS-SHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

With the growing availability of online cooking videos, there is unprecedented potential to study such culinary variations using computational tools systematically. However, existing video understanding methods fail to capture the fine-grained, multimodal, and culturally grounded differences in procedural cooking videos. This work presents the first large-scale, curated dataset of biryani preparation videos, comprising 120 high-quality YouTube recordings across 12 distinct regional styles. We propose a multi-stage framework leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units and align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text. Building on these aligned representations, we introduce a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. We construct a comprehensive question-answer (QA) benchmark spanning multiple reasoning levels to evaluate procedural understanding in VLMs. Our approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles, incorporates human-in-the-loop verification for high-precision tasks, and benchmarks several state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The resulting dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos.

However, several high-profile incidents involving large-scale drone failures -- where multiple drones simultaneously fall from the sky -- have raised safety and reliability concerns. To ensure robustness, we propose a drone parking algorithm designed specifically for multiple drone failures in drone light shows, aimed at mitigating the risk of cascading collisions by drone evacuation and enabling rapid recovery from failures by leveraging strategically placed hidden drones. Our algorithm integrates a Social LSTM model with attention mechanisms to predict the trajectories of failing drones and compute near-optimal evacuation paths that minimize the likelihood of surviving drones being hit by fallen drones. In the recovery node, our system deploys hidden drones (operating with their LED lights turned off) to replace failed drones so that the drone light show can continue.

Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models.

Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e3\u500d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u5efa\u95e8\u63a7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5347\u7ea7\u9608\u503c\u548c\u53d1\u5e03-\u8ba2\u9605\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e3\u500d\uff0cPSNR=38.3dB\uff0cSSIM=0.965\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u6548\u7387\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f02\u5e38\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u63a7\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u4e14\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Preprint version of a manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics", "summary": "This paper presents a single-actuator passive gripper that achieves both stable grasping and continuous bidirectional in-hand rotation through mechanically encoded power transmission logic. Unlike conventional multifunctional grippers that require multiple actuators, sensors, or control-based switching, the proposed gripper transitions between grasping and rotation solely according to the magnitude of the applied input torque. The key enabler of this behavior is a Twisted Underactuated Mechanism (TUM), which generates non-coplanar motions, namely axial contraction and rotation, from a single rotational input while producing identical contraction regardless of rotation direction. A friction generator mechanically defines torque thresholds that govern passive mode switching, enabling stable grasp establishment before autonomously transitioning to in-hand rotation without sensing or active control. Analytical models describing the kinematics, elastic force generation, and torque transmission of the TUM are derived and experimentally validated. The fabricated gripper is evaluated through quantitative experiments on grasp success, friction-based grasp force regulation, and bidirectional rotation performance. System-level demonstrations, including bolt manipulation, object reorientation, and manipulator-integrated tasks driven solely by wrist torque, confirm reliable grasp to rotate transitions in both rotational directions. These results demonstrate that non-coplanar multifunctional manipulation can be realized through mechanical design alone, establishing mechanically encoded power transmission logic as a robust alternative to actuator and control intensive gripper architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u6267\u884c\u5668\u88ab\u52a8\u5939\u6301\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u4f20\u8f93\u903b\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u53cc\u5411\u624b\u5185\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5668\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ec5\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u626d\u77e9\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5939\u6301\u5668\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5668\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u626d\u66f2\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u6784\uff08TUM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f93\u5165\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u5171\u9762\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u8f74\u5411\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6469\u64e6\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u673a\u68b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u626d\u77e9\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u88ab\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u611f\u6216\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5939\u6301\u5668\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u65cb\u8f6c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6f14\u793a\u5305\u62ec\u87ba\u6813\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u5411\u548c\u4ec5\u7531\u8155\u90e8\u626d\u77e9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u53ef\u9760\u6293\u53d6-\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5171\u9762\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u673a\u68b0\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u4f20\u8f93\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u6267\u884c\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5939\u6301\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While text has traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange is possible if models can access each other's internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models.

This is useful in cases where the amount of data is large and labelling is expensive, such as in machine vision or medical imaging. Two particularities of machine vision are first, that most of the images produced are free of defects, and second, that the amount of images produced is so big that we cannot store all acquired images. This results, on the one hand, in a strong class imbalance in defect distribution and, on the other hand, in a potential label shift caused by limited storage. To understand how these two forms of imbalance affect active learning algorithms, we propose a simulation study based on two open-source datasets. We artificially create datasets for which we control the levels of class imbalance and label shift.

Accepted by Nonlinear Dynamics", "summary": "This paper introduces a novel family of single-track vehicle models that incorporate a distributed representation of transient tyre dynamics, whilst simultaneously accounting for nonlinear effects induced by friction. The core of the proposed framework is represented by the distributed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) model, which unifies and extends classical formulations such as Dahl and LuGre by describing the rolling contact process as a spatially distributed system governed by semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This model is systematically integrated into a single-track vehicle framework, where the resulting semilinear ODE-PDE interconnection captures the interaction between lateral vehicle motion and tyre deformation. Two main variants are considered: one with rigid tyre carcass and another with flexible carcass, each admitting a compact state-space representation. Local and global well-posedness properties for the coupled system are established rigorously, highlighting the dissipative and physically consistent properties of the distributed FrBD model. A linearisation procedure is also presented, enabling spectral analysis and transfer function derivation, and potentially facilitating the synthesis of controllers and observers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to capture micro-shimmy oscillations and transient lateral responses to advanced steering manoeuvres. The proposed formulation advances the state-of-the-art in vehicle dynamics modelling by providing a physically grounded, mathematically rigorous, and computationally tractable approach to incorporating transient tyre behaviour in lateral vehicle dynamics, when accounting for the effect of limited friction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5355\u8f68\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FrBD\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6469\u64e6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6469\u64e6-\u9b03\u6bdb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(FrBD)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u8f68\u8f66\u8f86\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u534a\u7ebf\u6027ODE-PDE\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u521a\u6027\u8f6e\u80ce\u80ce\u4f53\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u80ce\u4f53\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8017\u6563\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u98a4\u632f\u632f\u8361\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u6a2a\u5411\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

This paper develops a lightweight estimator for minimally-congested car travel times that integrates open road-network data, speed constraints, and sparse control/turn features within a random forest framework to correct bias from shortest-path traversal-time baselines. Using an urban testbed, the pipeline: (i) constructs drivable networks from volunteered geographic data; (ii) solves Dijkstra routes minimizing edge traversal time; (iii) derives sparse operational features (signals, stops, crossings, yield, roundabouts; left/right/slight/U-turn counts); and (iv) trains a regression ensemble on limited high-quality reference times to generalize predictions beyond the training set. Out-of-sample evaluation demonstrates marked improvements over traversal-time baselines across mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, relative bias, and explained variance, with no significant mean bias under minimally congested conditions and consistent k-fold stability indicating negligible overfitting. The resulting approach offers a practical middle ground for transportation engineering: it preserves point-to-point fidelity at metropolitan scale, reduces resource requirements, and supplies defensible performance estimates where congestion feeds are inaccessible or cost-prohibitive, supporting planning, accessibility, and network performance applications under low-traffic operating regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u62e5\u5835\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6c7d\u8f66\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u8def\u7f51\u6570\u636e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u63a7\u5236/\u8f6c\u5411\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6846\u67b6\u6821\u6b63\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u62e5\u5835\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a(i)\u4ece\u5fd7\u613f\u5730\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9a7e\u9a76\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b(ii)\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5c0f\u8fb9\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\uff1b(iii)\u63d0\u53d6\u7a00\u758f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\u3001\u505c\u8f66\u70b9\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u3001\u8ba9\u884c\u3001\u73af\u5c9b\uff1b\u5de6/\u53f3/\u5c0f/U\u8f6c\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\uff1b(iv)\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6837\u672c\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u62e5\u5835\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\uff0ck\u6298\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u660e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our approach demonstrates that incorporating physics-inspired inductive biases into neural architectures yields significant improvements: state-of-the-art video prediction (FVD: 287), 4x faster visual synthesis than diffusion models, and 3-18x inference speedup over transformer baselines while maintaining energy conservation over extended horizons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Akasha 2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Mamba-3\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f9b\u79ef\u5206\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u91c7\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6301\u4e453D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08FVD: 287\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5feb4\u500d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4transformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb3-18\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08<50ms\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

This work introduces a novel bearing-box approach that fully leverages modern 3D detection measurements that are widely available nowadays but have not been well explored for motion estimation so far. Unlike existing methods that rely on restrictive assumptions such as isotropic target shape and lateral motion, our bearing-box estimator can estimate both the target's motion and its physical size without these assumptions by exploiting the information buried in a 3D bounding box. When applied to multi-rotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), the estimator yields an interesting advantage: it further removes the need for higher-order motion assumptions by exploiting the unique coupling between MAV's acceleration and thrust. This is particularly significant, as higher-order motion assumptions are widely believed to be necessary in state-of-the-art bearing-based estimators. We support our claims with rigorous observability analyses and extensive experimental validation, demonstrating the estimator's superior performance in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ebearing-box\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee33D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee33D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1bearing-box\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u75283D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u5fae\u578b\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a8\u529b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfbearing-based\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional methods, AISCycleGen leverages unpaired domain translation to generate high-fidelity synthetic AIS data sequences without requiring paired source-target data. The framework employs a 1D convolutional generator with adaptive noise injection to preserve the spatiotemporal structure of AIS trajectories, enhancing the diversity and realism of the generated data. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply AISCycleGen to several baseline regression models, showing improvements in performance across various maritime domains. The results indicate that AISCycleGen outperforms contemporary GAN-based augmentation techniques, achieving a PSNR value of 30.5 and an FID score of 38.9.

We present ObjSplat, an active reconstruction framework that leverages Gaussian surfels as a unified representation to progressively reconstruct unknown objects with both photorealistic appearance and accurate geometry. Addressing the limitations of conventional opacity or depth-based cues, we introduce a geometry-aware viewpoint evaluation pipeline that explicitly models back-face visibility and occlusion-aware multi-view covisibility, reliably identifying under-reconstructed regions even on geometrically complex objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of greedy planning strategies, ObjSplat employs a next-best-path (NBP) planner that performs multi-step lookahead on a dynamically constructed spatial graph. By jointly optimizing information gain and movement cost, this planner generates globally efficient trajectories. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real-world cultural artifacts demonstrate that ObjSplat produces physically consistent models within minutes, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and surface completeness while significantly reducing scan time and path length compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

However, their integration with online reinforcement learning remains challenging due to fundamental incompatibilities between diffusion model training objectives and standard RL policy improvement mechanisms. This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families -- Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods -- based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness. Our analysis identifies key findings regarding the fundamental trade-offs inherent in each algorithmic family, particularly concerning sample efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we reveal critical computational and algorithmic bottlenecks that currently limit the practical deployment of online DPRL.

Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a tendon-driven robotic wrist joint together with an efficient Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) for precise motion control. The wrist mechanism is modeled using a Timoshenko-based approach to accurately capture its kinematic and dynamic properties, which serve as the foundation for tendon force calculations within the controller. The proposed SMC is designed to deliver fast dynamic response and computational efficiency, enabling accurate trajectory tracking under varying operating conditions. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through comparative analyses with existing controllers for similar wrist mechanisms. The proposed SMC demonstrates superior performance in both simulation and experimental studies. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in simulation is approximately 1.67e-2 radians, while experimental validation yields an error of 0.2 radians. Additionally, the controller achieves a settling time of less than 3 seconds and a steady-state error below 1e-1 radians, consistently observed across both simulation and experimental evaluations. Comparative analyses confirm that the developed SMC surpasses alternative control strategies in motion accuracy, rapid convergence, and steady-state precision.

However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI.

This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range.

While the Robot Operating System (ROS) has been widely adopted as the backbone of these robotic applications in both academia and industry, its asynchronous, multiprocess design complicates reproducibility, especially across varying hardware platforms. Deterministic callback execution cannot be guaranteed when computation times and communication delays vary. This lack of reproducibility complicates scientific benchmarking and continuous integration, where consistent results are essential. To address this, we present a methodology to create deterministic simulations using ROS 2 nodes. Our ROS Simulation Library for C++ (RSLCPP) implements this approach, enabling existing nodes to be combined into a simulation routine that yields reproducible results without requiring any code changes.

Existing methods lack internal reasoning mechanisms that can identify task-relevant interaction cues or track progress within a subtask, leading to critical execution errors such as repeated actions, missed steps, and premature termination. To address these challenges, we introduce PALM, a VLA framework that structures policy learning around interaction-centric affordance reasoning and subtask progress cues. PALM distills complementary affordance representations that capture object relevance, contact geometry, spatial placements, and motion dynamics, and serve as task-relevant anchors for visuomotor control. To further stabilize long-horizon execution, PALM predicts continuous within-subtask progress, enabling seamless subtask transitions. Across extensive simulation and real-world experiments, PALM consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 91.8% success rate on LIBERO-LONG, a 12.5% improvement in average length on CALVIN ABC->D, and a 2x improvement over real-world baselines across three long-horizon generalization settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "PALM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\u6216\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u9057\u6f0f\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u7ec8\u6b62\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "PALM\u56f4\u7ed5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPALM\u5728LIBERO-LONG\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.8%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5728CALVIN ABC->D\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u957f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534712.5%\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u957f\u671f\u6cdb\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6bd4\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PALM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fdb\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains. Comprehensive statistical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRainBalance\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3GNSS\u7ad9\u70b9\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u975e\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u964d\u6c34\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "GNSS\u7ad9\u70b9\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u9762\u4e34\u964d\u6c34\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u964d\u6c34\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRainBalance\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u62df\u5408\u5355\u4e00\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6807\u7b7e\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5c06RainBalance\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RainBalance\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The model combines genomic variation, cardiac MRI, ECG waveforms, wearable streams, and structured EHR data to predict risk while also implementing causal invariance constraints across different clinical subpopulations.\n  To maintain transparency, we employ SHAP based feature attribution, counterfactual explanations and causal latent alignment for understandable risk factors.

Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u7684\u4e3b\u52a83D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a83D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u826f\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f53\u7d20\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u70b9\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u6f14\u793a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HERE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u8db3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

However, the unique characteristics of sonar images, such as complex noise patterns and the lack of elevation information, pose significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. In this paper, we present NAS-GS, a novel Noise-Aware Sonar Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed to address these challenges. Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real-world large-scale offshore sonar scenarios, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAS-GS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u548cGMM\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u6709\u7684\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u7eb3\u6210\u50cf\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u6d77\u6d0b\u8003\u53e4\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u6709\u7684\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9ad8\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u7ed93D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8def\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u58f0\u7eb3\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4fa7\u74e3\u3001\u6563\u6591\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u7eb3\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u5cb8\u58f0\u7eb3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "NAS-GS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing solutions typically resort to training embodiment-specific models, which scales poorly and fails to exploit shared motion semantics. To address this, we present AdaMorph, a unified neural retargeting framework that enables a single model to adapt human motion to diverse robot morphologies. Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration. Experimental results on 12 distinct humanoid robots demonstrate that AdaMorph effectively unifies control across heterogeneous topologies, exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to unseen complex motions while preserving the dynamic essence of the source behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaMorph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u89c6\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5f62\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff08AdaLN\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdaMorph\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6e90\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaMorph\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Deep learning approaches have been constrained by the scarcity of CTG recordings with clinical outcome labels. We present the first application of self-supervised pre-training to intrapartum CTG analysis, leveraging 2,444 hours of unlabeled recordings for masked pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the 552-recording CTU-UHB benchmark. Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal.

Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle.

Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\\% (compared to 62.5\\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u53c9\u8f66\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5b50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u822a\u9700\u8981\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u5b50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7531\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u4eff-\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gazebo\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u738794.2%\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf62.5%\uff09\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1121.4%\uff0c\u653e\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u57281.5\u5398\u7c73\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "HMER\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u53c9\u8f66\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7269\u6599\u642c\u8fd0\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A prompt that returns clean JSON on GPT-4 may produce fenced, prose-wrapped, or malformed output on Llama, causing strict parsers to reject otherwise correct extractions. We formalize this as format collapse and introduce a dual-metric evaluation framework: ROS (strict parsing, measuring operational reliability) and CSS (post-canonicalization, measuring semantic capability). On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, we find severe format collapse (for example, Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 versus CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). We then present PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight verifier (DistilBERT) and a safe-override policy. PromptPort recovers format failures (plus 6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (plus 14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 versus 0.896 in zero-shot) without modifying base models.

We present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, utilizing the quadruped ANYmal, equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our modular autonomy stack integrates a mission planning interface, global planner, localization framework, and terrain-aware local navigation. We evaluated the system on Mount Etna across three autonomous missions in varied terrain, achieving successful gas-source detections with autonomy rates of 93-100%.

DPO, GRPO methods typically imprint one behavior into the weights, leaving little runtime control beyond prompt hacks or expensive re-alignment. We introduce ECLIPTICA, which treats alignment as instruction-driven and runtime-controllable: natural-language alignment instructions act as an explicit behavioral contract (stance, refusal boundary, verbosity) that modulates behavior on the fly under evolving safety requirements, user roles, and governance constraints.\n  We introduce CITA (Contrastive Instruction-Tuned Alignment), combining SFT with contrastive preference optimization under an explicit geometric anchor to a reference model. This yields a stable Riemannian chart and keeps instruction updates within a shared neighborhood, so regimes stay nearby and traversable for reliable switching.\n  To isolate policy switching from ordinary instruction following, we release the ECLIPTICA benchmark: 3000 controlled cases (300 prompts x 10 instruction types) where the user request is fixed and only the alignment instruction changes. On Llama-3.1-8B across five suites (ECLIPTICA, TruthfulQA, Conditional Safety, Length Control, LITMUS), CITA reaches 86.7% instruction-alignment efficiency, beating DPO (56.1%), GRPO (36.1%), and PPO (20.4%).", "AI": {"tldr": "ECLIPTICA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DPO\u3001GRPO\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7b56\u7565\u88ab\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u7528\u6237\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CITA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fdd\u6301\u90bb\u8fd1\u4e14\u53ef\u904d\u5386\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-3.1-8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cCITA\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523086.7%\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eDPO\uff0856.1%\uff09\u3001GRPO\uff0836.1%\uff09\u548cPPO\uff0820.4%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ECLIPTICA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u63a7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining. Our new benchmark, source code, and pre-trained models will be publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Object-WIPER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u66ff\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6548\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u79fb\u9664\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u63a9\u7801\u878d\u5408\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u6f14\u83b7\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u80cc\u666f\u6807\u8bb0\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAVIS\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7279\u6548\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08WIPER-Bench\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cObject-WIPER\u5728\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "Object-WIPER\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u79fb\u9664\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Subsequently, a time-optimal model predictive contouring control (MPCC) incorporates safe flight corridor (SFC) constraints at variable horizon steps to enable aggressive yet safe maneuvering, while fully exploiting the MAV's dynamics. We validate the proposed framework extensively on a custom-built LiDAR-based MAV platform.

Since a first study yielded inconclusive results, a second study with improved methodology (i.e., systematic information extraction and different prediction outcome) was conducted. In Study 1, some pretrained random forests descriptively outperformed the standard random forest. However, this improvement was not significant (t(99) = 0.89, p = 0.19).

Existing methods for predicting student engagement typically require substantial annotated data to model the diversity of student behaviors, yet privacy concerns often restrict researchers to their own proprietary datasets. Moreover, the classroom context, represented in peers' actions, is ignored. To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments.

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing inherently supports privacy-preserving interaction, making it a promising modality for room-scale HRI. However, existing mmWave-based interaction-sensing systems exhibit poor spatial generalization at unseen distances or viewpoints. To address this challenge, we introduce WaveMan, a spatially adaptive room-scale perception system that restores reliable human interaction sensing across arbitrary user positions. WaveMan integrates viewpoint alignment and spectrogram enhancement for spatial consistency, with dual-channel attention for robust feature extraction. Experiments across five participants show that, under fixed-position evaluation, WaveMan achieves the same cross-position accuracy as the baseline with five times fewer training positions. In random free-position testing, accuracy increases from 33.00% to 94.33%, enabled by the proposed method.

However, extending multi-concept unlearning to large-scale scenarios remains difficult due to three challenges: (i) conflicting weight updates that hinder unlearning or degrade generation; (ii) imprecise mechanisms that cause collateral damage to similar content; and (iii) reliance on additional data or modules, creating scalability bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality.

Compared with image outpainting, it requires not only per-frame spatial plausibility but also long-range temporal coherence, especially when outpainted content becomes visible across time under camera or object motion. We propose GlobalPaint, a diffusion-based framework for spatiotemporal coherent video outpainting. Our approach adopts a hierarchical pipeline that first outpaints key frames and then completes intermediate frames via an interpolation model conditioned on the completed boundaries, reducing error accumulation in sequential processing. At the model level, we augment a pretrained image inpainting backbone with (i) an Enhanced Spatial-Temporal module featuring 3D windowed attention for stronger spatiotemporal interaction, and (ii) global feature guidance that distills OpenCLIP features from observed regions across all frames into compact global tokens using a dedicated extractor.

Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\\SI{100}{\\milli\\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \\textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \\textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\\% to 100\\%).", "AI": {"tldr": "NanoCockpit\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u7a0b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u7eb3\u7c73\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u591a\u6838\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7eb3\u7c73\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5c42\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u677f\u8f7d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u7a0b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684NanoCockpit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u591a\u6838\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001MCU\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u548cWi-Fi\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684TinyML\u7eb3\u7c73\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u96f6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e32\u884c\u5f00\u9500\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e30%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece40%\u63d0\u5347\u81f3100%\u3002", "conclusion": "NanoCockpit\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6613\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This index continuously modulates the learner's effective learning rate, reducing update magnitude during instability and restoring it as reliability improves. We provide a Lyapunov-based proof sketch establishing bounded adaptation of the reliability dynamics under mild assumptions (smooth loss, descent direction, and bounded reflex outputs).

Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances.

Beltran-Hernandez", "Kazutoshi Tanaka", "Masashi Hamaya"], "title": "Stable In-hand Manipulation for a Lightweight Four-motor Prosthetic Hand", "comment": null, "summary": "Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and designed with motors enclosed inside to protect them from damage and dirt. Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism.

Across these tracks, multiple challenges span diverse flow datasets and use cases, each emphasizing different model requirements. The challenge is open to anyone, and we invite broad participation to build a comprehensive and balanced picture of what works and where current methods fall short.

However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

This work unites these paradigms to achieve perceptive general motion control. We present a framework where exteroceptive sensing is integrated into whole-body motion tracking, permitting a humanoid to perform highly dynamic, non-locomotion tasks on uneven terrain. By training a single policy to perform multiple distinct motions across varied terrestrial features, we demonstrate the non-trivial benefit of integrating perception into the control loop. Our results show that this framework enables robust, highly dynamic multi-contact motions, such as vaulting and dive-rolling, on unstructured terrain, significantly expanding the robot's traversability beyond simple walking or running. https://project-instinct.github.io/deep-whole-body-parkour", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u53cc\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6b65\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5ffd\u7565\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5916\u611f\u53d7\u611f\u77e5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6210\u5982\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u7ffb\u6eda\u7b49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7a7f\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Family data from ground testing or previous flights is commonly used to detect initiating failure modes and their timing; however, this approach relies heavily on engineering judgment and is more error-prone for new launch vehicles. To address these limitations, we utilize Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for supervised classification of time-series anomalies. Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors. In this work, we propose a novel statistical detector based on the Mahalanobis distance and forward-backward detection fractions to adjust the supervised training labels. We demonstrate our method on digital twin simulations of a ground-stage propulsion system with 20.8 minutes of operation per trial and O(10^8) training timesteps.

However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \\textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \\textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts.

However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets.

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies.

Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseOccVLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5360\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684token\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u64c5\u957f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4f46\u5b58\u5728token\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0eVLM\u6709\u6548\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparseOccVLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u5360\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5360\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6865\u6881\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u7531LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728OmniDrive-nuScenes\u4e0aCIDEr\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53477%\uff0c\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\u4e0amIoU\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad80.5\uff0c\u5728nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u521b\u4e0b\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseOccVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5360\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86VLM\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification.

Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol.

Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "VVTRec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c04\u7535\u5e72\u6d89\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c04\u7535\u5929\u6587\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u6b8b\u7559\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf", "method": "\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVVTRec\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "conclusion": "VVTRec\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5c04\u7535\u5929\u6587\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c04\u7535\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks.

This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction.

Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.\n  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.\n  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "MB-ICL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ICL\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "MB-ICL\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u539f\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u539f\u578b\u90bb\u8fd1\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u8bcd\u6c47\u6216\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6f14\u793a\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMB-ICL\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6ICL\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u539f\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbICL\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u95ee\u7b54\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u7d22\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change.

Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales.

Conversely, traditional CNN-based baselines offer real-time inference but struggle with \"over-smoothing,\" failing to recover fine structural details in extreme low-light conditions. This creates a practical gap in the literature: the lack of a model that provides generative-level texture recovery at edge-deployable speeds. In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s.

To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce BabyVision, a benchmark designed to assess core visual abilities independent of linguistic knowledge for MLLMs. BabyVision spans a wide range of tasks, with 388 items divided into 22 subclasses across four key categories. Empirical results and human evaluation reveal that leading MLLMs perform significantly below human baselines. Gemini3-Pro-Preview scores 49.7, lagging behind 6-year-old humans and falling well behind the average adult score of 94.1. These results show despite excelling in knowledge-heavy evaluations, current MLLMs still lack fundamental visual primitives. Progress in BabyVision represents a step toward human-level visual perception and reasoning capabilities.

Although several deep temporal clustering algorithms have demonstrated a strong advantage over traditional methods in terms of model learning and clustering results, the accuracy of the few algorithms are not satisfactory. None of the existing algorithms can continuously learn new tasks and deal with the dynamic data effectively and efficiently in the sequential tasks learning. To bridge the gap and tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm \\textbf{L}ifelong \\textbf{D}eep \\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{C}lustering (\\textbf{LDTC}), which effectively integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into an end-to-end deep unsupervised learning framework. Using a specifically designed autoencoder and jointly optimizing for both the latent representation and clustering objective, the LDTC can achieve high-quality clustering results. Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy. Experiments on seven real-world multivariate time series datasets show that the LDTC is a promising method for dealing with temporal clustering issues effectively and efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLDTC\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7ec8\u8eab\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "LDTC\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8c\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLDTC\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5e8f\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LDTC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002"}}

Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data. We further introduce Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation, and integrate it into GLOWDeblur, a Generalizable reaL-wOrld lightWeight Deblur model that combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment module with a lightweight diffusion backbone. Extensive experiments on six widely-used benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate our approach, confirming the importance of blur priors for robust generalization and demonstrating that the lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practicality in real-world applications.

State-of-the-art methods demonstrate strong performance when trained and tested within the same domain. However, they struggle to generalise to new environments due to limited training data and depth perception -- overfitting to specific camera intrinsics. Our method addresses this by estimating keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space, normalised by focal length and image size, enabling camera-agnostic depth prediction. We further leverage this invariance to camera intrinsics to propose a self-supervised test-time optimisation strategy that refines the model's depth perception during inference. This is achieved by applying a 3D consistency loss between predicted and in-space scale-transformed hand poses, allowing the model to adapt to target domain characteristics without requiring ground truth annotations. V-HPOT significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios, achieving a 71% reduction in mean pose error on the H2O dataset and a 41% reduction on the AssemblyHands dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, V-HPOT outperforms all single-stage approaches across all datasets and competes closely with two-stage methods, despite needing approximately x3.5 to x14 less data.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-HPOT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u70b9z\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u673a\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u70b9z\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u673a\u65e0\u5173\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e94\u75283D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cH2O\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e73\u5747\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e71%\uff0cAssemblyHands\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u964d\u4f4e41%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u6fc0\u70c8\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c113.5\u523014\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "V-HPOT\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u673a\u65e0\u5173\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSCAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f00\u96c6CAD\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e3D\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df3D\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u652f\u63016D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2dCAD\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u96c6\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GroundedSAM\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528DINOv2\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728MI3DOR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728YCB-V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523090.48%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "OSCAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7269\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a6D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device. These results support a practical smaller wins observation that a small model can match or exceed a large teacher for edge-based prognostics with proper supervision and selection.

However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \\textit{what} and \\textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \\textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMTrack\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f3a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5229\u7528Grounding DINO\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0cLLaVA-OneVision\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8de8\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u80cc\u540e\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u4ec0\u4e48\u548c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u7a7a\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u6765\u9002\u914d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728BenSMOT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLLMTrack\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMTrack\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These comparisons rely on large sets of high-fidelity synthetic images enabling deep exploration of the 6 degrees of freedom. A low-discrepancy sampling of the space allows to check the correlations between each degree of freedom and the pose errors by plotting the 36 pairs of combinations. The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy. This method is applied to well-known markers, revealing their strengths and weaknesses for pose estimation.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly employed for this task, existing approaches predominantly train models to associate events with timestamps in the forward video only. This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs. Specifically, we categorize events into time-sensitive (e.g., putting down a bag) and time-insensitive (e.g., holding a towel in the left hand). The former denote events whose reversal substantially alters their meaning, while the latter remain semantically unchanged under reversal. For time-sensitive events, ArrowGEV introduces a reward that encourages VLMs to discriminate between forward and backward videos, whereas for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions.

We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections.

This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average.

Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing.

Existing approaches often depend on task-specific retraining or expensive inversion procedures, which can compromise content integrity, reduce style fidelity, and lead to an unsatisfactory trade-off between semantic prompt adherence and style alignment. In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided synthesis as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion. We further analyze the imbalance and noise sensitivity inherent in multimodal attention fusion and propose a Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism that reweights attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens, effectively resolving guidance conflicts and enhancing output coherence. Experiments show that our approach achieves high-fidelity stylization with superior semantic-style balance and visual quality, offering a simple yet powerful alternative to complex, artifact-prone prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49-\u98ce\u683c\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u53d7\u635f\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ReFlow\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49-\u98ce\u683c\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49-\u98ce\u683c\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training. By addressing overlap at both pseudo-label and synthesis levels, our work advances scalable, label-efficient organoid analysis, unlocking new potential for high-throughput applications in precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u89e3\u6df7\uff08PLU\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u970010%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPseudo-Label Unmixing\uff08PLU\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u53e0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u89e3\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u6210\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cd\u53e0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u524d\u5bf9\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u589e\u5f3a\uff08IA\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PLU\u3001\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5408\u6210\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5668\u5b98\u6837\u4f53\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing research shows that even small prompt changes can lead to substantial differences in output, but has mainly focused on a narrow set of perturbations with small academic datasets, limiting their relevance to real-world applications. To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates robustness across multiple perturbation types, including general text edits (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), formatting changes (e.g., JSON, YAML), multilingual and cross-lingual inputs, and positional variations in instructions. Evaluating 11 models ranging from 4B to 120B+ parameters, we find that minor perturbations reduce performance by up to 40 percentage points on key enterprise metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that the relationship between model size and robustness is more nuanced than conventional assumptions suggest: an 8B parameter model (Ministral 3 8B) outperforms most larger models, while another 8B model (Llama 3.1 8B) performs worst overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7LLM\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe40\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981LLM\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u901a\u7528\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u6807\u70b9\u3001\u7a7a\u683c\uff09\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\uff08JSON\u3001YAML\uff09\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8611\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece4B\u5230120B+\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4f7f\u5173\u952e\u4f01\u4e1a\u6307\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe40\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u590d\u6742\uff1a8B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Ministral 3 8B\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a8B\u6a21\u578bLlama 3.1 8B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7LLM\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Event cameras, with their asynchronous contrast sensing, offer natural robustness to such artifacts, yet a controlled benchmark for winter-sport tracking has been missing. We introduce event SkiTB (eSkiTB), a synthetic event-based ski tracking dataset generated from SkiTB using direct video-to-event conversion without neural interpolation, enabling an iso-informational comparison between RGB and event modalities. Benchmarking SDTrack (spiking transformer) against STARK (RGB transformer), we find that event-based tracking is substantially resilient to broadcast clutter in scenes dominated by static overlays, achieving 0.685 IoU, outperforming RGB by +20.0 points. Across the dataset, SDTrack attains a mean IoU of 0.711, demonstrating that temporal contrast is a reliable cue for tracking ballistic motion in visually congested environments. eSkiTB establishes the first controlled setting for event-based tracking in winter sports and highlights the promise of event cameras for ski tracking.

This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view. These results demonstrate that integrating zero-shot segmentation with self-supervised feature learning enables high-throughput, reproducible nanomaterial analysis, transforming a labor-intensive bottleneck into a scalable, data-driven process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Segment Anything Model\uff08SAM\uff09\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u548cDINOv2\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8695.5%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd2\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8eSegment Anything Model\uff08SAM\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u9897\u7c92\u5206\u5272\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675fDINOv2\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u9897\u7c92\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u57281,800\u5f20TEM\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u533a\u5206\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cCNT\u5f62\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523095.5%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u6837\u54c1\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u540c\u4e00\u89c6\u91ce\u4e2d\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9897\u7c92\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u74f6\u9888\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

The anticlustering problem is NP-hard. We focus on anticlustering in Euclidean spaces, where the input data is tabular and each object is represented as a D-dimensional feature vector. Distances are measured as squared Euclidean distances between the respective vectors. Applications of Euclidean anticlustering include social studies, particularly in psychology, K-fold cross-validation in which each fold should be a good representative of the entire dataset, the creation of mini-batches for gradient descent in neural network training, and balanced K-cut partitioning. In particular, machine-learning applications involve million-scale datasets and very large values of K, making scalable anticlustering algorithms essential. Existing algorithms are either exact methods that can solve only small instances or heuristic methods, among which the most scalable is the exchange-based heuristic fast_anticlustering. We propose a new algorithm, the Assignment-Based Anticlustering algorithm (ABA), which scales to very large instances. A computational study shows that ABA outperforms fast_anticlustering in both solution quality and running time. Moreover, ABA scales to instances with millions of objects and hundreds of thousands of anticlusters within short running times, beyond what fast_anticlustering can handle. As a balanced K-cut partitioning method for tabular data, ABA is superior to the well-known METIS method in both solution quality and running time.

However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.\n  This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.\n  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6cd5\u533b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5ba1\u67e5\u8679\u819c\u5339\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u5dee\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5224\u65ad\u6837\u672c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\uff1a(a) \u4e0d\u540c\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1b(b) \u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u773c\u775b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e/\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u8679\u819c\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u76f8\u540c\u773c\u775b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u5bf9\u5224\u65ad\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u773c\u775b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

This undermines the core goal of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We propose Monkey Jump, a method that brings mixture-of-experts-style specialization to parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing extra trainable parameters for experts or routers. Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects. Across multi-task experiments covering 14 text, 14 image, and 19 video benchmarks, Monkey Jump achieves competitive performance with mixture-of-experts-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods while using 7 to 29 times fewer trainable parameters, up to 48 percent lower memory consumption, and 1.5 to 2 times faster training.

We combine gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with a precomputed STRING protein-protein interaction network to classify tissue origin and distinguish between normal and tumor samples. The model employs Chebyshev graph convolutions (K=2) and weighted pooling layers, aggregating gene clusters into 'supernodes' across multiple coarsening levels. This approach enables dimensionality reduction while preserving meaningful interactions. Saliency methods were applied to interpret the model by identifying key genes and biological processes relevant to cancer. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of convolution and pooling layers did not enhance classification performance. The highest F1-macro score (0.978) was achieved with a single pooling layer. However, adding more layers resulted in over-smoothing and performance degradation. However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures.

They stay reliable under lighting changes produce bounded values and connect well to biophysical signals. Even so, they are usually treated as a fixed pre processing step with coefficients set to one, which limits how well they can adapt to a specific learning task. In this study, we introduce the Normalized Difference Layer that is a differentiable neural network module. The proposed method keeps the classical idea but learns the band coefficients from data. We present a complete mathematical framework for integrating this layer into deep learning architectures that uses softplus reparameterization to ensure positive coefficients and bounded denominators. We describe forward and backward pass algorithms enabling end to end training through backpropagation. This approach preserves the key benefits of normalized differences, namely illumination invariance and outputs bounded to $[-1,1]$ while allowing gradient descent to discover task specific band weightings. We extend the method to work with signed inputs, so the layer can be stacked inside larger architectures.

In real scenarios such as personalized recommendation and cross-device user profiling, the global cluster may be fragmented and distributed among different clients, and the clusters may exist at different granularities or even nested. Although Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is considered promising for exploring such distributions, the sophisticated recursive clustering process makes it more computationally expensive and vulnerable to privacy exposure, thus relatively unexplored under the federated learning scenario. This paper introduces an efficient one-shot hierarchical FC framework that performs client-end distribution exploration and server-end distribution aggregation through one-way prototype-level communication from clients to the server. A fine partition mechanism is developed to generate successive clusterlets to describe the complex landscape of the clients' clusters. Then, a multi-granular learning mechanism on the server is proposed to fuse the clusterlets, even when they have inconsistent granularities generated from different clients. It turns out that the complex cluster distributions across clients can be efficiently explored, and extensive experiments comparing state-of-the-art methods on ten public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u7b7e\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u6216\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u539f\u578b\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5212\u5206\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u7c07\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7c07\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u590d\u6742\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose Decoupled Self-Correction (DSC), a novel two-stage methodology. DSC first fully optimizes the DLM's generative ability before freezing the model and training a specialized correction head. This decoupling preserves the model's peak SFT performance and ensures the generated errors used for correction head training are of higher quality. Additionally, we introduce Future-Context Augmentation (FCA) to maximize the correction head's accuracy. FCA generalizes the error training distribution by augmenting samples with ground-truth tokens, effectively training the head to utilize a richer, future-looking context. This mechanism is used for reliably detecting the subtle errors of the high-fidelity base model. Our DSC framework enables the model, at inference time, to jointly generate and revise tokens, thereby correcting errors introduced by multi-token generation and mitigating error accumulation across steps.

However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains.

A lightweight pre-matching stage uses mutual nearest neighbors and RANSAC to estimate these cues, then constructs an Information-Weighted Spanning Tree (IWST) augmented with targeted edges for loop closure, long-baseline anchors, and weak-view reinforcement. Compared to exhaustive matching, SARA reduces rotation errors by 46.5+-5.5% and translation errors by 12.5+-6.5% across modern learned detectors, while achieving at most 50x speedup through 98% pair reduction (from 30,848 to 580 pairs).

However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data.

These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints.

In contrast, PRISM allocates sampling density proportional to chormatic diversity. By treating RGB color space as the stratification domain and imposing a maximum capacity k per color bin, the method preserves texture-rich regions with high color variation while substantially reducing visually homogeneous surfaces.

In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to $4\\times$ longer than its attention window.

Recent streaming methods reduce latency by interleaving perception and generation, but still enforce a sequential perception-generation cycle, limiting real-time interaction. In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency. We further show that the proposed framework yields up to 2x acceleration under balanced perception-generation workloads, establishing a principled pathway toward speak-while-watching real-time systems.

Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples.

We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES.

Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

We introduce LookaHES, a nonmyopic BO framework designed for dynamic, history-dependent cost environments, where evaluation costs vary with prior actions, such as travel distance in spatial tasks or edit distance in sequence design. LookaHES combines a multi-step variant of $H$-Entropy Search with pathwise sampling and neural policy optimization, enabling long-horizon planning beyond twenty steps without the exponential complexity of existing nonmyopic methods. The key innovation is the integration of neural policies, including large language models, to effectively navigate structured, combinatorial action spaces such as protein sequences. These policies amortize lookahead planning and can be integrated with domain-specific constraints during rollout. Empirically, LookaHES outperforms strong myopic and nonmyopic baselines across nine synthetic benchmarks from two to eight dimensions and two real-world tasks: geospatial optimization using NASA night-light imagery and protein sequence design with constrained token-level edits. In short, LookaHES provides a general, scalable, and cost-aware solution for robust long-horizon optimization in complex decision spaces, which makes it a useful tool for researchers in machine learning, statistics, and applied domains.

Yet, the current visual inspection based on optical cameras offers limited quality of service to that respect. In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection.

Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules.

However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset.

However, their application to Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) -- a typical scenario in energy systems -- remains largely unexplored. Considering the nonlinear and fluctuating characteristics of the load data, effectively utilizing the powerful modeling capabilities of diffusion models to enhance STELF accuracy remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network. To validate the effectiveness of the MFRD model, we conducted experiments on two data platforms: Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE). The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the compared models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9891\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08MFRD\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u671f\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\uff08STELF\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63d0\u5347STELF\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "MFRD\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a(1)\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\uff1b(2)\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u524a\u5f31\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff1b(3)\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u548cTransformer\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u53bb\u9664\uff1b(4)\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728AEMO\u548cISO-NE\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMFRD\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MFRD\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9891\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77ed\u671f\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although recent deep learning approaches leverage diffusion model priors with geometry buffers (G-buffers) to produce visually compelling results without explicit scene geometry or light simulation, they remain constrained by two major limitations. First, the iterative nature of the diffusion process introduces substantial latency. Second, the inherent stochasticity of these generative models compromises physical accuracy and temporal consistency. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel, end-to-end, deterministic, single-step neural rendering framework, RenderFlow, built upon a flow matching paradigm. To further strengthen both rendering quality and generalization, we propose an efficient and effective module for sparse keyframe guidance. Our method significantly accelerates the rendering process and, by optionally incorporating sparsely rendered keyframes as guidance, enhances both the physical plausibility and overall visual quality of the output. The resulting pipeline achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic rendering quality, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of modern generative models and the precision of traditional physically based rendering.

While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\\times$. This scalability is achieved without compromising accuracy and speed, and in fact reducing latency by 4.12%-23.26%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mosaic\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(dLLMs)\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86dLLMs\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3adLLMs\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u5728logits\u548cFFNs\u4e4b\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "Mosaic\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ec5\u63a9\u7801\u7684logits\u6838\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u60f0\u6027\u5206\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u5cf0\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u5168\u5c40\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5bfb\u5740\u89e3\u51b3\u788e\u7247\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aMosaic\u5c06\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u5747\u6bd4\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e2.71\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6700\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4e8615.89-32.98\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c114.12%-23.26%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Mosaic\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u9759\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86dLLMs\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A central challenge in measuring such social bias is attribution under visual confounding: real-world images entangle race and gender with correlated factors such as background and clothing, obscuring attribution. We propose a \\textbf{face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm} that isolates demographic effects while preserving real-image realism. Starting from real photographs, we generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender, keeping all other visual factors fixed. Based on this paradigm, we construct \\textbf{FOCUS}, a dataset of 480 scene-matched counterfactual images across six occupations and ten demographic groups, and propose \\textbf{REFLECT}, a benchmark comprising three decision-oriented tasks: two-alternative forced choice, multiple-choice socioeconomic inference, and numeric salary recommendation. Experiments on five state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that demographic disparities persist under strict visual control and vary substantially across task formulations.

VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains.

Solutions of lower functional complexity are known to produce abstractions that generalise more effectively and are more robust to input perturbations. In complex hypothesis spaces, inductive biases make such solutions learnable by shaping the loss geometry during optimisation. In a HEP classification task, we show that a soft symmetry respecting inductive bias creates approximate degeneracies in the loss, which we identify as pseudo-Goldstone modes.

This limitation is particularly pronounced in the underexplored task of visual grading, where models should not only solve a problem but also diagnose errors in hand-drawn diagrams. Such diagnostic capabilities depend on complex structural, semantic, and metacognitive reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SketchJudge, a novel benchmark tailored for evaluating MLLMs as graders of hand-drawn STEM diagrams. SketchJudge encompasses 1,015 hand-drawn student responses across four domains: geometry, physics, charts, and flowcharts, featuring diverse stylistic variations and distinct error types. Evaluations on SketchJudge demonstrate that even advanced MLLMs lag significantly behind humans, validating the benchmark's effectiveness in exposing the fragility of current vision-language alignment in symbolic and noisy contexts.

In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work.

However, they still operate under a ``one-size-fits-all'' paradigm and struggle to model user-specific concepts (e.g., generate a photo of \\texttt{<maeve>}) in a consistent and controllable manner. Existing personalization methods typically rely on external retrieval, which is inefficient and poorly integrated into unified multimodal pipelines. Recent personalized unified models introduce learnable soft prompts to encode concept information, yet they either couple understanding and generation or depend on complex multi-stage training, leading to cross-task interference and ultimately to fuzzy or misaligned personalized knowledge. We present \\textbf{OmniPersona}, an end-to-end personalization framework for unified LMMs that, for the first time, integrates personalized understanding, generation, and image editing within a single architecture. OmniPersona introduces structurally decoupled concept tokens, allocating dedicated subspaces for different tasks to minimize interference, and incorporates an explicit knowledge replay mechanism that propagates personalized attribute knowledge across tasks, enabling consistent personalized behavior. To systematically evaluate unified personalization, we propose \\textbf{\\texttt{OmniPBench}}, extending the public UnifyBench concept set with personalized editing tasks and cross-task evaluation protocols integrating understanding, generation, and editing. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPersona delivers competitive and robust performance across diverse personalization tasks.

We show that these can be alleviated via effective context engineering. We first impose structure into the initial prompt with DS-specific input fields, that serve as instructions for the agentic system. The solution is then materialized as an enumerated sequence of interleaved plan and code blocks generated by separate LLM agents, providing a readable structure to the context at any step of the workflow. Function calls for generating these intermediate texts, and for corresponding Python code, ensure that data stays local, and only aggregate statistics and associated instructions are injected into LLM prompts.

A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \\alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \\alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback.

However, training large language models (LLMs) to simulate and predict possible student errors in their responses to these problems can be challenging: they often suffer from mode collapse and fail to fully capture the diversity in syntax, style, and solution approach in student responses. In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity.

Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enables non-invasive tumor characterization, clinical workflows typically acquire only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast agent dose. In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches. Experiments on a dataset of 960 cases (886 internal cases split 7:1:2 for training/validation/testing, and 74 external cases evaluated via five-fold cross-validation) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 0.893, 0.824, and 0.857 for ER, PR, and HER2 classification, respectively, and a mean absolute error of 8.2\\% for Ki-67 regression, significantly outperforming radiomics and single-task deep learning baselines.

While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PromptMIA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6076\u610f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u63d2\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u76d1\u63a7\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u8303\u5f0f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPromptMIA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6076\u610f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u662f\u5426\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePromptMIA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u8f93\u51fa\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9PromptMIA\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify two fundamental causes of this fragility: the reliance on local pixel dependencies for preserving tissue structure and the dependence on multiscale spectral-spatial representations for hierarchical feature encoding. Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible.

Building on prior work introducing an energy-aware parameter efficiency metric, this study empirically examines the effects of increasing training token counts under fixed hardware and training conditions. The significance of this work lies in the explicit integration of power consumption and execution duration, as reflected by the power sampling frequency, into token-scale analysis. This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M). While conventional performance metrics exhibited inconsistent or diminishing returns across token scales, the inclusion of power consumption and execution duration revealed a strictly monotonic decline in training efficiency as token count increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a strong effect of token count on parameter efficiency, with all pairwise comparisons remaining significant following Bonferroni correction. These findings indicate that increases in training token counts may be energetically inefficient even when marginal performance improvements are observed, underscoring the importance of efficiency-aware evaluation in large language model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3token\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740token\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5448\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8fb9\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3token\u6570\u91cf\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e0d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u529f\u7387\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u957f\u660e\u786e\u6574\u5408\u5230token\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u7684GPU\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548cepoch\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf91.1\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684TinyLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2atoken\u6570\u91cf\uff0850\u4e07\u3001100\u4e07\u548c200\u4e07\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u529f\u7387\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5305\u542b\u529f\u7387\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u968f\u7740token\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5448\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cfANOVA\u663e\u793atoken\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728Bonferroni\u6821\u6b63\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3token\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0d\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8fb9\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6548\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance.

Currently, a paramount concern for VQA in this domain is the stringent requirement for fast latency and real-time processing, as delays directly impact real-world safety in this safety-critical application. However, current state-of-the-art VQA models, particularly large vision-language models (VLMs), often prioritize performance over computational efficiency. These models typically process dense patch tokens for every frame, leading to prohibitive computational costs (FLOPs) and significant inference latency, especially with long video sequences. This focus limits their practical deployment in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient VLM framework for autonomous driving VQA tasks, SRC-Pipeline. It learns to compress early frame tokens into a small number of high-level tokens while retaining full patch tokens for recent frames.

However, this plasticity is not universal: while instruction-tuned models utilized the budget to elongate their chain-of-thought and maximize reward, heavily math-aligned models suffered performance collapse, suggesting that noisy, low-budget RL updates can act as destructive interference for models already residing near a task-specific optimum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\uff08\u5355A40 GPU\u8bad\u7ec324\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u22641.5B\uff09\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u5f3a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\uff08LoRA\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5355A40 GPU\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c24\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u79e9\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08r=256\uff09\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728AIME 24\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523040.0% Pass@1\uff08\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534711.1%\uff09\uff0cPass@16\u8fbe\u523070.0%\u3002\u4f46\u6570\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97RL\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u5df2\u63a5\u8fd1\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5339\u914d\u662f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, WCC-Net improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE). Moreover, WCC-Net generalizes robustly to unseen dose levels (1/50 and 1/4), achieving superior quantitative performance and improved volumetric anatomical consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "WCC-Net\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u6210\u50cf\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u60a3\u8005\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u53bb\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u968f\u673a\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u79ef\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWCC-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5165\u660e\u786e\u7684\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u652f\u5c06\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u90e81/20\u5242\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWCC-Net\u6bd4\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebfPSNR\u63d0\u9ad8+1.21 dB\uff0cSSIM\u63d0\u9ad8+0.008\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5242\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73\uff081/50\u548c1/4\uff09\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "WCC-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient.

In particular, it is often unclear whether a model relies on true clinical cues or on spurious hierarchical correlations in the data. This paper introduces a simple yet broadly applicable trustworthiness test grounded in stochastic proof-by-contradiction. Instead of just showing high test performance, our approach trains and tests on spurious labels carefully permuted based on a potential outcomes framework. A truly trustworthy model should fail under such label permutation; comparable accuracy across real and permuted labels indicates overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage. Our approach quantifies this behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values, which are well understood by domain experts across medical and life sciences. We evaluate our approach on multiple new bacterial diagnostics to separate tasks and models learning genuine causal relationships from those driven by dataset artifacts or statistical coincidences.

This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes.

In educational settings, AI powered systems have become essential for predicting student performance due to their advanced analytical capabilities. However, effectively leveraging diverse student data to uncover latent and complex patterns remains a key challenge. While prior studies have explored this area, the potential of dynamic data features and multi category entities has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates heterogeneous graph deep learning models to enhance early and continuous student performance prediction, using traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. Our approach employs a graph metapath structure and incorporates dynamic assessment features, which progressively influence the student success prediction task. Experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset demonstrate promising results, achieving a 68.6% validation F1 score with only 7% of the semester completed, and reaching up to 89.5% near the semester's end. Our approach outperforms top machine learning models by 4.7% in validation F1 score during the critical early 7% of the semester, underscoring the value of dynamic features and heterogeneous graph representations in student success prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u7ee9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u671f\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u529f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6309\u65f6\u6bd5\u4e1a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u9010\u6b65\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728Open University Learning Analytics\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u671f\u4ec5\u5b8c\u62107%\u65f6\u8fbe\u523068.6%\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u671f\u672b\u8fbe\u523089.5%\u3002\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b66\u671f\u524d7%\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1F1\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u9876\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51fa4.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a real-time motion focus recognition method that estimates the subject's locomotion intention from any egocentric video. Our approach leverages the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduces system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference. Evaluated on a collected egocentric action dataset, our method achieves real-time performance with manageable memory consumption through a sliding batch inference strategy.

An Anatomy of the Rashomon Effect", "comment": null, "summary": "The Rashomon effect -- the existence of multiple, distinct models that achieve nearly equivalent predictive performance -- has emerged as a fundamental phenomenon in modern machine learning and statistics. In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners.

Philip Chen", "Tong Zhang"], "title": "Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network for Reliable Multimodal Classification", "comment": "14 pages,9 figures, 8 tables", "summary": "Reliable learning on low-quality multimodal data is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications. However, multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain and leads existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to reliably remove heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAHCD\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u53bb\u9664\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5728\u9047\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "TAHCD\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6837\u672c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u53bb\u9664\u5f02\u6784\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c42\u9762\u534f\u540c\u53bb\u9664\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "TAHCD\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) allows hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing raw images, but current FL algorithms typically assume a static data distribution. In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework. EWC constrains updates along parameters deemed important for previous tasks, while a memory of latent prototypes preserves class structure without storing raw images. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) at each client adds calibrated Gaussian noise to clipped gradients, providing formal privacy guarantees for individual radiographs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDP-FedEPC\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u591a\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u591a\u673a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DP-FedEPC\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5f39\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u5de9\u56fa\uff08EWC\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u56de\u653e\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002EWC\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u4e0d\u5b58\u50a8\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\uff0cDP-SGD\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "DP-FedEPC\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e14\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning.

While the general prediction of such motion for an arbitrary control mechanism is difficult, for a particular choice of control, the dynamics reduces to the Lie-Poisson equations [33,34]. Our goal is to learn the phase-space dynamics and predict the motion solely from observations, without any knowledge of the control Hamiltonian or the nature of interaction between vehicles. To achieve that goal, we propose the Control Optimal Lie-Poisson Neural Networks (CO-LPNets) for learning and predicting the dynamics of the system from data. Our methods learn the mapping of the phase space through the composition of Poisson maps, which are obtained as flows from Hamiltonians that could be integrated explicitly. CO-LPNets preserve the Poisson bracket and thus preserve Casimirs to machine precision. We discuss the completeness of the derived neural networks and their efficiency in approximating the dynamics. To illustrate the power of the method, we apply these techniques to systems of $N=3$ particles evolving on ${\\rm SO}(3)$ group, which describe coupled rigid bodies rotating about their center of mass, and ${\\rm SE}(3)$ group, applicable to the movement of unmanned air and water vehicles. Numerical results demonstrate that CO-LPNets learn the dynamics in phase space from data points and reproduce trajectories, with good accuracy, over hundreds of time steps.

Our framework includes four key components: A recorder that captures screen video along with precise user interactions like mouse clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls. A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions. A planner that reads the parsed demonstrations, maintains task states, and dynamically formulates the next high-level action plan based on contextual reasoning. An executor that faithfully carries out these action plans at the OS level, performing precise clicks, drags, text inputs, and window operations with safety checks and real-time feedback.

In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea0\u7f20\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LoRA\u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\"\u65e0\u6bdb\"\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u4f4e\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\uff08MPS\uff09\u8868\u793a\u6765\u523b\u753b\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLaMA 1B\u548c8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728Tulu3\u548cOpenThoughts3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83LoRA\u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff08FFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LoRA\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u503c\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ea0\u7f20\u9075\u5faa\u4f53\u79ef\u5f8b\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\"\u7ea0\u7f20\u8c37\"\uff0c\u800c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u7ea0\u7f20\u9075\u5faa\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9c81\u68d2\uff1bLoRA\u548cFFT\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ea0\u7f20\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\"\u65e0\u6bdb\"\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MPS Adaptation\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We introduce a synthetic dataset generation framework that path-traces 3D glass models over real background imagery to create physically accurate reflection scenarios with varied glass properties, camera settings, and post-processing effects. To leverage the capabilities of Large Multimodal Model (LMM), we concatenate the image layers into a single composite input, apply joint captioning, and fine-tune the model using task-specific LoRA rather than full-parameter training.

ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations.

SceneNAT is trained via masked modeling over fully discretized representations of both semantic and spatial attributes. By applying a masking strategy at both the attribute level and the instance level, the model can better capture intra-object and inter-object structure. To boost relational reasoning, SceneNAT employs a dedicated triplet predictor for modeling the scene's layout and object relationships by mapping a set of learnable relation queries to a sparse set of symbolic triplets (subject, predicate, object).

As a result, many approaches have been designed to detect it, and lately Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as a competent candidate. However, when trained with a large amount of data, they are slow and computationally demanding. In addition, GNNs may need a deep architecture to detect complex fraud patterns, but doing so may make them suffer from problems such as over-fitting or over-smoothing. Over-fitting leads to reduced generalisation of the model on unseen data, while over-smoothing causes all nodes' features to converge to a fixed point due to excessive aggregation of information from neighbouring nodes. In this research, I propose an approach called One-Side Edge Sampling (OES) that can potentially reduce training duration as well as the effects of over-smoothing and over-fitting. The approach leverages predictive confidence in an edge classification task to sample edges from the input graph during a certain number of epochs. To explain why OES can alleviate over-smoothing, I perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. In addition, to validate the effect of OES, I conduct experiments using different GNNs on two datasets. The results show that OES can empirically outperform backbone models in both shallow and deep architectures while also reducing training time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOne-Side Edge Sampling (OES)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u8fb9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGNN\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u7684\u8fb9\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1OES\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOES\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4", "conclusion": "OES\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347GNN\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408/\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898"}}

Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "VENUS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u8f6c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u79bb\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u8f6c\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u62a4\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728PIE-Bench\u4e0a\uff0cPSNR\u4ece22.45\u63d0\u5347\u81f324.80\uff0cSSIM\u4ece0.79\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.84\uff0cLPIPS\u4ece0.100\u964d\u4f4e\u81f30.070\uff1b\u5728EditVal\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f970.87 DINO\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5355\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece6-10\u5206\u949f\u7f29\u77ed\u81f320-30\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "VENUS\u5728\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy.

A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy.

Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak.

In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings.

Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Google AlphaEarth\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ed1\u5761\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5236\u56fe\u66ff\u4ee3\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AE\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6ed1\u5761\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6ed1\u5761\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5236\u56fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6ed1\u5761\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5236\u56fe\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002AE\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u8868\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u533a\u57df\uff08\u53f0\u6e7e\u5357\u6295\u53bf\u3001\u9999\u6e2f\u548c\u610f\u5927\u5229\u827e\u7c73\u5229\u4e9a-\u7f57\u9a6c\u6d85\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08CNN1D\u3001CNN2D\u548cVision Transformer\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83AE\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u548c\u5b8c\u657464\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfLCFs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AE\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u533a\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eLCFs\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea64%-15%\uff0cAUC\u503c\u589e\u52a00.04-0.11\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eAE\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u56fe\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6ed1\u5761\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u5761\u6613\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "AE\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6ed1\u5761\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5236\u56fe\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53AE\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6ed1\u5761\u6e05\u5355\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering. Each submodel is trained independently and in parallel on its assigned data subset using low-cost devices, without any inter-device communication. Subsequently, all experts are integrated into a complete MoE model and fine-tuned globally for a short period on high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs. Experiments show that our method matches or even surpasses full-parameter training in performance across multiple downstream tasks, loss function, and perplexity (PPL), while reducing training cost by 47.6 percent to 69.5 percent on Qwen1.5-MoE-2.7B and Llama-MoE-3.5B across different datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE-DisCo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5bc6\u96c6\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbdGPU\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u786c\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e47.6%\u81f369.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE-DisCo\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity.

To alleviate this bottleneck, we leverage diffusion models to perform semantics-preserving augmentation on the video and audio modalities, expanding the multimodal training distribution. However, increasing data quantity alone is insufficient, as diffusion-generated samples exhibit substantial quality variation and noisy augmentations may degrade performance. We therefore propose DaQ-MSA (Denoising and Qualifying Diffusion Augmentations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis), which introduces a quality scoring module to evaluate the reliability of augmented samples and assign adaptive training weights. By down-weighting low-quality samples and emphasizing high-fidelity ones, DaQ-MSA enables more stable learning.

This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFocal Guidance\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u8026\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5f31\u5c42\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709I2V\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0DiT\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5f31\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFocal Guidance\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\uff08FSG\uff09\u5229\u7528CLIP\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u6307\u5bfc\u8bed\u4e49\u5f31\u5c42\uff1b2\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f13\u5b58\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\u5c42\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u5f31\u5c42\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wan2.1-I2V\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u603b\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.7250\uff08+3.97%\uff09\uff0c\u5728MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.5571\uff08+7.44%\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Focal Guidance\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3I2V\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations.

We develop and validate an active learning framework that iteratively selects informative training structures for machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) from large, heterogeneous materials databases, specifically the Materials Project and OQMD. Our framework integrates compositional and property-based descriptors with a neural network ensemble model, enabling real-time uncertainty quantification via Query-by-Committee. We systematically compare four selection strategies: random sampling (baseline), uncertainty-based sampling, diversity-based sampling (k-means clustering with farthest-point refinement), and a hybrid approach balancing both objectives. Experiments across four representative material systems (elemental carbon, silicon, iron, and a titanium-oxide compound) with 5 random seeds per configuration demonstrate that diversity sampling consistently achieves competitive or superior performance, with particularly strong advantages on complex systems like titanium-oxide (10.9% improvement, p=0.008). Our results show that intelligent data selection strategies can achieve target accuracy with 5-13% fewer labeled samples compared to random baselines. The entire pipeline executes on Google Colab in under 4 hours per system using less than 8 GB of RAM, thereby democratizing MLIP development for researchers globally with limited computational resources. Our open-source code and detailed experimental configurations are available on GitHub.

However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity.

Although extensive research has focused on developing efficient machine unlearning strategies, we argue that these methods mainly aim at removing samples rather than removing samples' influence on the model, thus overlooking the fundamental definition of machine unlearning. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing unlearning schemes when the training dataset includes many samples similar to those targeted for unlearning.

Our extensive experiments, conducted on four carefully constructed datasets with thorough analysis, reveal a notable gap between the expected and actual performance of most existing unlearning methods for image and language models, even for the retraining-from-scratch baseline.

We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process.

In recent years, deep learning methods have been demonstrated to outperform mechanistic models at the task of hydrological discharge simulation. Adoption of these methods has been catalysed by the proliferation of large sample hydrology datasets, consisting of the observed discharge and meteorological drivers, along with geological and topographical catchment descriptors. Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited. The lack of adoption of deep learning methodologies is primarily due to sparsity or lack of the spatiotemporal observational data required to enable downstream model training. We therefore investigate the application of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for hydrological discharge simulation in the transboundary Limpopo River basin, emphasising application to data scarce regions. We conduct a number of computational experiments primarily focused on assessing the impact of varying the LSTM model input data on performance. Results confirm that data constraints remain the largest obstacle to deep learning applications across African river basins. We further outline the impact of human influence on data-driven modelling which is a commonly overlooked aspect of data-driven large-sample hydrology approaches and investigate solutions for model adaptation under smaller datasets.

Multi-image reasoning presents fundamental challenges including complex inter-relationships between images and scattered critical information across image sets. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose the Cognition-Inspired Meta-Action Framework (CINEMA), a novel approach that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions: Global, Focus, Hint, Think, and Answer which explicitly modeling the sequential cognitive steps humans naturally employ. For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks.

However, standard integer quantization (e.g., INT4) fundamentally degrades per- formance by imposing a uniform grid on the heavy-tailed distribution of weight parameters, particularly in smaller-scale models (e.g., <2B parameters). We introduce HAS-VQ (Hessian-Adaptive Sparse Vec- tor Quantization), a compression framework that strictly decouples high-sensitivity outliers from the bulk weight distribution using second-order sensitivity analysis. HAS-VQ employs a Hessian-Masked Decoupling strategy to isolate sensitive parameters, followed by robust Vector Quantization (VQ) of the remaining dense body. Crucially, we introduce a residual sparse feedback mechanism that corrects quan- tization errors in the most sensitive dimensions, ensuring exact reconstruction of outliers. We evaluate HAS-VQ on SmolLM2-1.7B, demonstrating two distinct regimes of superiority: (1) Pareto Dominance over Integer Baselines: At 4.23 effective bits-per-parameter (BPP), we achieve a perplexity of 14.23, significantly outperforming the standard INT4 baseline (20.03 PPL at 4.71 BPP). (2) High-Fidelity Compression: Relative to the FP16 baseline, HAS-VQ achieves a 2.3x reduction in model size (7.03 BPP) while maintaining statistically indistinguishable perplexity (10.12 vs. 10.04), effectively offering a lossless compression alternative for bandwidth-constrained environments.

Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a \"data scale-method-performance\" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the \"Channel-Multi-scale Spatial\" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the \"Spatial-Channel\" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules.

A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed). However,the problem of certified unlearning under non-i.i.d. deletions remains largely unexplored. In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning.

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PulseMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6216\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u6d89\u53ca\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u9700\u8981\u5728\u533b\u60a3\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1)\u6784\u5efaMediScope\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b98,000\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u8f6e\u4f1a\u8bca\u548c601,500\u5f20\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2)\u5f00\u53d1PulseMind Benchmark\u591a\u8f6e\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff1b3)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(CRPO)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPulseMind\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u4f1a\u8bca\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u516c\u5171\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PulseMind\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This distinction is largely academic for single-shot inference, but becomes critical for agentic AI systems, where a single rephrased prompt can trigger cascading failures in multi-step execution. Yet this form of instability is not captured by existing evaluations.\n  Hallucinations live in variance: they arise when semantically equivalent prompts activate inconsistent internal pathways, producing divergent outputs. Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement. SS is a diagnostic for variance-driven unreliability, not a method for improving correctness.\n  We show that a dense Qwen3-0.6B agrees with itself only 23.8% of the time; at 32% sparsity, agreement jumps to 55.9%.

To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer.

Zico Kolter"], "title": "When Should We Introduce Safety Interventions During Pretraining?", "comment": null, "summary": "Ensuring the safety of language models in high-stakes settings remains a pressing challenge, as aligned behaviors are often brittle and easily undone by adversarial pressure or downstream finetuning. Prior work has shown that interventions applied during pretraining, such as rephrasing harmful content, can substantially improve the safety of the resulting models. In this paper, we study the fundamental question: \"When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?\" We keep the underlying data fixed and vary only the choice of a safety curriculum: the timing of these interventions, i.e., after 0%, 20%, or 60% of the pretraining token budget. We find that introducing interventions earlier generally yields more robust models with no increase in overrefusal rates, with the clearest benefits appearing after downstream, benign finetuning. We also see clear benefits in the steerability of models towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples.

Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence.

Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies.

Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence. These findings support potential utility for automated ECG screening pending validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bfc\u8054\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9057\u4f20\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\uff08ARVC\u548cLQTS\uff09\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03ECG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bfc\u8054\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9057\u4f20\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\uff08\u5982ARVC\u548cLQTS\uff09\u4e0e\u5fc3\u6e90\u6027\u731d\u6b7b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728ECG\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408ECG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752813\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u961f\u5217\uff08645\u540d\u60a3\u8005\uff1b1,344\u4efdECG\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cdECG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bfc\u8054\u611f\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LASAN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u8054\u7ec4\u63a9\u853d\u91cf\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u8054\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u5b8f\u89c2AUROC 0.904\uff09\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5bfc\u8054\u611f\u77e5\u96c6\u6210\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08HuBERT-ECG\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5b8f\u89c2AUROC 0.990\uff09\u3002\u5bfc\u8054\u63a9\u853d\u663e\u793a\u751f\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1aV1-V3\u5bfc\u8054\u5bf9ARVC\u68c0\u6d4b\u6700\u5173\u952e\uff08AUROC\u964d\u4f4e4.54%\uff09\uff0c\u4fa7\u58c1\u5bfc\u8054\u5bf9LQTS\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff08AUROC\u964d\u4f4e2.60%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bfc\u8054\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9057\u4f20\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bfc\u8054\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316ECG\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To accelerate inference, feature caching methods have emerged by reusing intermediate representations across timesteps. However, existing caching approaches treat all feature components uniformly. We reveal that DiT feature spaces contain distinct principal and residual subspaces with divergent temporal behavior: the principal subspace evolves smoothly and predictably, while the residual subspace exhibits volatile, low-energy oscillations that resist accurate prediction. Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention.

SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties. Of the 19 molecules, 14 were synthesized and 13 were experimentally confirmed. The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns).

Traditional deep learning models often suffer from overfitting and high computational costs. Self-distillation (SD), a variant of knowledge distillation where a network learns from its own predictions, has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance model performance without requiring external teacher networks. In this work, we explore the application of SD to HSI by treating earlier outputs as soft targets, thereby enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions.

While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Veto\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728logit\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u6216\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVeto\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728logit\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570beta\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u5426\u51b3\uff08\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u6743\u8861\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVeto\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Veto\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties.

Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \\textbf{4\\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question. We opine that such query-based frame selection can enhance accuracy in a wide range of tasks that rely on only a subset of video frames.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b50\u6a21\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u91cd\u8981\u5e27\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u6a21\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u5e27\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5f0f\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe4%\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9009\u5e27\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Recently, dynamic resolution sampling has emerged as a promising acceleration technique by reducing the resolution of early sampling steps. However, existing methods rely on heuristic re-noising at every resolution transition, injecting noise that breaks cross-stage consistency and forces the model to relearn global structure. In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \\textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models.

Each article may earn up to two badges, each linked to verified code in its corresponding public repository. We describe the motivation, related initiatives, a formal framework, the potential impact, possible limitations, and alternative views.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fee\u6539ACM\u9884\u53d1\u8868\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5fbd\u7ae0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5411\u671f\u520a\u63d0\u4ea4\u53d1\u8868\u540e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6587\u7ae0\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5fbd\u7ae0\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u671f\u520a\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u8868\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u672a\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539ACM\u9884\u53d1\u8868\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5fbd\u7ae0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4ea4\u53d1\u8868\u540e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u6bcf\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u4e24\u4e2a\u5fbd\u7ae0\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5fbd\u7ae0\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u516c\u5171\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba4\u4e3a\u671f\u520a\u548c\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\u96c6\u5b9e\u65bd\u53d1\u8868\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing methods rely on uniform supervision, implicitly assuming a constant difficulty distribution across layout regions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by revealing a critical flaw: \\textbf{Positional Disparity}, a phenomenon where models demonstrate mastery over the deterministic start and end regions but suffer a performance collapse in the complex intermediate sections. This degradation arises because standard training allows the massive volume of easy patterns to drown out the learning signals from difficult layouts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FocalOrder}, a framework driven by \\textbf{Focal Preference Optimization (FPO)}.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocalOrder establishes new state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench v1.0 and Comp-HRDoc.

We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model.

However, achieving high-fidelity segmentation remains challenging due to adhesion artifacts in naturally occluded scans, which are caused by low contrast and indistinct inter-arch boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose the Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet), a coarse-to-fine framework designed to resolve boundary ambiguity while maintaining global structural consistency. Specifically, we introduce two mechanisms: the Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) and the Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA). The AGBR employs an entropy based gating mechanism to perform targeted feature rectification in high uncertainty transition zones. Meanwhile, the SDMAA integrates implicit geometric constraints via signed distance map to enforce topological consistency, preventing the loss of spatial details associated with standard pooling. Experimental results on a dataset of 125 CBCT volumes demonstrate that AACNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17 \\% and a 95\\% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63 mm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization on an external dataset with an HD95 of 2.19 mm, validating its reliability for downstream clinical applications such as surgical planning.

This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%.

However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSafety Optimal Transport (SOT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u53c2\u8003\"\u63a8\u62c9\"\u6743\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6392\u65a5\u6709\u5bb3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u635f\u3002", "method": "SOT\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u53cc\u53c2\u8003\"\u63a8\u62c9\"\u6743\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5c06\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u5e03\u62c9\u5411\u53ef\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u79bb\u4e00\u822c\u6709\u5bb3\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u51e0\u4f55\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSOT\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "SOT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fb5\u8680\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.\n  We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.\n  Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViewMorpher3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\u89c6\u56fe\u6765\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u67093D\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u89d2\u6216\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "ViewMorpher3D\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u7ec4\u6e32\u67d3\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u5305\u62ec\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u30013D\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u90bb\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u65ad\u7f3a\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u6291\u5236\u6e32\u67d3\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u53d8\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53c2\u8003/\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u56fe\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We derive structure-aware coverage guarantees under distribution shift using PAC-Bayesian bounds over ambiguity sets, and show that CalPro maintains near-nominal coverage while producing tighter intervals than standard conformal methods in regions where priors are informative. Empirically, CalPro exhibits at most 5% coverage degradation across modalities (vs. 15-25% for baselines), reduces calibration error by 30-50%, and improves downstream ligand-docking success by 25%.

We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis.

Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAESTRO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u771f\u503c\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u5982\u521b\u610f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u534f\u8c03\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7ec8\u7aef\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u74f6\u9888\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMAESTRO\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u9759\u6001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86GRPO\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u751a\u81f3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "MAESTRO\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86GRPO\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

CT data from the EuCanImage consortium (n=2437) and an external TCIA cohort (n=197) were used. Among several pretrained models, UMedPT achieved the best performance and was fine-tuned with an MLP head for classification and an FCOS-based head for lesion detection. The classification model achieved an AUC of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.82 on the combined test set, with a sensitivity of 0.85 on the external cohort. Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40. The detection model identified 69.1 percent of lesions overall, increasing from 30 percent to 98 percent across lesion size quartiles.

To address these issues, we propose DDT, a novel and robust deep learning framework for high-precision time-series forecasting. At its core, DDT introduces two key innovations. First, we design a dual-masking mechanism that synergistically combines a strict causal mask with a data-driven dynamic mask. This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques. Second, our architecture features a dual-expert system that decouples the modeling of temporal dynamics and cross-variable correlations into parallel, specialized pathways, which are then intelligently integrated through a dynamic gated fusion module.

We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(\u03a3_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $\u03a3_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $\u03a3_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u79e9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u5bb9\u91cf$C_{\\mathrm{ip}}$\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u89c2\u6d4b\u79e9\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\"\u7f3a\u5931\u5bb9\u91cf\"\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u57fa\u7684\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8ff0\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b/\u521b\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b$C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(\u03a3_{XX})$\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65afJohnson-Nyquist\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u7cbe\u786e\u5212\u5206\u4e86\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bfb\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u79e9\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf$C_{\\mathrm{i}}$\u63a7\u5236\u521b\u65b0\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5927\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u521b\u65b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u5177\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bf1\u5bfc\u521b\u65b0\u5757\u5f8b\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u521b\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings.

Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SLSQP\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570qEHVI\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SLSQP\uff09\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728ZDT1\u3001DTLZ2\u3001Kursawe\u548cLatent-Aware\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e0eSLSQP\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eSLSQP\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728DTLZ2\u548cLatent-Aware\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u80fd\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features. Second, we design a Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) to refine predictions by modeling contextual relationships through a dynamically constructed layout graph. Extensive experiments show PARL achieves state-of-the-art results. It establishes a new benchmark for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and, notably, surpasses even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. Crucially, PARL (65M) is highly efficient, using roughly four times fewer parameters than large multimodal models (256M), demonstrating that sophisticated visual structure modeling can be both more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPARL\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700OCR\u7684\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9OCR\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56OCR\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u5185\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u89c9\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "1. \u53cc\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u5143\u7d20\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u56fe\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocLayNet\u4e0a\u4e3a\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u7acb\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728M6Doc\u4e0a\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u5927\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002PARL\uff0865M\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u6bd4\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08256M\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea64\u500d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6bd4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\uff0cPARL\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation.

This limits the effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, existing methods fuse similarity graphs from multiple views by employing sample-invariant weights to preserve local structure. However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them.

Extended version of CVPR 2025 paper arXiv:2411.05738", "summary": "We present StdGEN++, a novel and comprehensive system for generating high-fidelity, semantically decomposed 3D characters from diverse inputs. Existing 3D generative methods often produce monolithic meshes that lack the structural flexibility required by industrial pipelines in gaming and animation. Addressing this gap, StdGEN++ is built upon a Dual-branch Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (Dual-Branch S-LRM), which jointly reconstructs geometry, color, and per-component semantics in a feed-forward manner. To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement.

Silvia Ruiz-Espa\u00f1a and Laura Arnal contributed equally to this work", "summary": "The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence.

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision.

While recent studies use synthetic images to improve License Plate Recognition (LPR) results, there remain several limitations in these efforts. This work addresses these constraints by comprehensively exploring the integration of real and synthetic data to enhance LPR performance. We subject 16 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to a benchmarking process involving 12 public datasets acquired from various regions. Several key findings emerge from our investigation. Primarily, the massive incorporation of synthetic data substantially boosts model performance in both intra- and cross-dataset scenarios. We examine three distinct methodologies for generating synthetic data: template-based generation, character permutation, and utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, each contributing significantly to performance enhancement. The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data.

However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Segmental Advantage Estimation\uff08SAE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u4e2dPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u3002SAE\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5b50\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6bb5\u8fb9\u754c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728RLVR\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u95f4\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0cGAE\uff08\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u52bf\u65f6\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6982\u7387token\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8fb9\u754c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u5b50\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6bb5\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e2d\u95f4token\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSAE\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5206\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9eSAE\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "SAE\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86RLVR\u4e2dGAE\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CompNO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u5143\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u6570\u5316PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u5757\u5e93\uff08Foundation Blocks\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u672c\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5757\uff08Adaptation Blocks\uff09\u7ec4\u88c5\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5907\u4e13\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7b97\u5b50", "result": "\u5728PDEBench\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08PFNO\u3001PDEFormer\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Burgers\u6d41\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e14\u96f6\u635f\u5931", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3aPDE\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes \"near-miss\" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9VLMs\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SNRA\u7b97\u5b50\u548cAP-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316Sigmoid\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u75283D\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u6837\u672c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u6ed1\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff08SNRA\uff09\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559GRPO\uff08AP-GRPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002SNRA\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316Sigmoid\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\uff1bAP-GRPO\u96c6\u6210\u7edd\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b5\u4e07\u4e2a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc13D\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684Numerical3D-50k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAP-GRPO\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u6d3bVLMs\u7684\u6f5c\u57283D\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AP-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLMs\u57283D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation.

Cai"], "title": "SCALPEL: Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large Language Model Interpretability Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCALPEL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u79fb\u9664\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u8f91\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLiMP\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSCALPEL\u6210\u529f\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6d88\u878d\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art.

Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \\textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models. Our method is not only more flexible for different backbones but also has the potential to be adopted for a wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks.

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely.

Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion.

However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics.

However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16.

While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis.

Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps.

This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as \"opposing staircases\" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u7531\u9057\u61be\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570(LLC)\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u76f8\u53d8\u4f1a\u4ece\u9ad8\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u5411\u4f4e\u9057\u61be\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4ece\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660e\u7b56\u7565\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u7531\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdfSGD\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u53d8\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\"\u5bf9\u7acb\u9636\u68af\"\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u9057\u61be\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u540c\u65f6LLC\u589e\u52a0\u3002LLC\u80fd\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u9057\u61be\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6355\u6349\u7684\u662f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e95\u5c42\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The dominant approach, adaptive sufficient-statistics perturbation (AdaSSP), adds an adaptively chosen perturbation to the sufficient statistics, namely, the matrix $X^{\\top}X$ and the vector $X^{\\top}Y$, and is known to achieve near-optimal accuracy and to have strong empirical performance. In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches. Then, we show that our new approach circumvents the intrinsic limitations of the prior methods and provides non-trivial improvements over AdaSSP.

However, their precise interpretation faces significant challenges due to high annotation costs, leading to data scarcity, and the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in capturing complex temporal patterns. To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability.

Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

However, realizing these benefits in practice is non-trivial, as dLLMs inherently face an accuracy-parallelism trade-off. Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement. The delay might lead to elevated mortality rates. These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis.

However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference.

However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRiskEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u65e2\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u6210\u672c\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u505a\u51fa\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7528\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u8eab\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u771f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RiskEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u5f03\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60e9\u7f5a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u4ece\u4e0d\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9891\u7e41\u5f03\u6743\u662f\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6218\u7565\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care.

Latham", "Andrew Saxe"], "title": "Optimal Learning Rate Schedule for Balancing Effort and Performance", "comment": null, "summary": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour.
