However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ece\u5ba2\u670d\u901a\u8bdd\u5f55\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Llama 2 7B\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06LLM\u9002\u914d\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u672a\u7ecf\u6574\u7406\u7684\u5ba2\u670d\u901a\u8bdd\u5f55\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u6df7\u4e71\u3002", "method": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\uff08\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u964d\u566a\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5f55\uff09\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\uff08\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u3001\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff09\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u5ba2\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5ba2\u670d\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u4e3a\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u529f\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8eLlama 2 7B\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u5ba2\u670d\u901a\u8bdd\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ba2\u670d\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \\emph{unique}, \\emph{redundant}, and \\emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \\emph{\\textbf{D}ivide and \\textbf{R}efine} (\\textbf{DnR}). In the \\textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \\textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations.

Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSOS\u811a\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u671d\u5411\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1SOSControl\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u8282\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u89c2\u6307\u5b9a\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u671d\u5411\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faSOS\u811a\u672c\uff1a\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u671d\u5411\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\uff1b2. \u81ea\u52a8SOS\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e27\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684SOS\u811a\u672c\uff1b3.

A Unified Evaluation of llama.cpp Quantization on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "comment": "17 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure", "summary": "Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9llama.cpp\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u7b97\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff08FP16\uff0cGGUF\u683c\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d63-8\u4f4dK-quant\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\u3001\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3001CPU\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff08\u9884\u586b\u5145/\u89e3\u7801\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3allama.cpp\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u667a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, infrastructure constraints, dynamic environments, and the computational demands of multi-agent coordination limit real-world deployment in high-risk scenarios such as wildfires and disaster response. This paper investigates the integration of LLM-based agentic AI and edge computing to realize scalable and resilient autonomy in UAV swarms. We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels. Then, a use case for wildfire search and rescue (SAR) is designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the edge-enabled architecture, enabling high SAR coverage, reduced mission completion times, and a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we highlight open challenges in integrating LLMs and edge computing for mission-critical UAV-swarm applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u91ce\u706b\u641c\u6551\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fdAI\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u4e2d\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9650\u5236\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u3001\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f7f\u80fd\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u6df7\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u90fd\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u91ce\u706b\u641c\u6551\u7528\u4f8b\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f7f\u80fd\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f7f\u80fd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u641c\u6551\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u641c\u6551\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210LLM\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8c03\u6216\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Vision Transformer\u3001Wav2Vec2\u548cBERT\uff09\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684Kubernetes\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cTensorFlow Serving\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEMOCAP\u3001MELD\u548cAffectNet\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1aF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53473.0%\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e12.9%\u3002\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e3a128ms\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u51cf\u5c1135%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5ba2\u670d\u3001\u865a\u62df\u6559\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5411\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic \"kickback\" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions. Our findings promote the advancement of haptic feedback systems for robotic surgery, offering a realistic and reliable interface for robot-assisted surgical procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u963b\u6297\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5(NIMA)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u6709IMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c1195%\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u89e6\u89c9\"\u53cd\u5f39\"\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f(RAMIS)\u4e2d\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u957f\u671f\u53d7\u5230\u529b\u6e32\u67d3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u963b\u6297\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5(NIMA)\uff0c\u5728\u5148\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u963b\u6297\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5(IMA)\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5de5\u5177-\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u3002", "result": "NIMA\u5c06\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f30.01N\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u5dee0.02N\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4IMA\u51cf\u5c1195%\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u89e6\u89c9\"\u53cd\u5f39\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u677e\u5f00\u624b\u67c4\u65f6\u89e6\u89c9\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u65bd\u52a0\u4efb\u4f55\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "NIMA\u80fd\u591f\u8003\u8651\u5de5\u5177-\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u624b\u672f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u529b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u754c\u9762\u3002"}}

However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u8349\u8393\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bdropout\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u529b\u95ed\u5408\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u4e0b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u51c6\u5219\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u6267\u884c\u6293\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8349\u8393\u91c7\u6458\u4e2d\u53f6\u7247\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u76843D\u8865\u5168\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e00\u8865\u5168\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8865\u5168\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bdropout\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8865\u5168\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u529b\u95ed\u5408\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709\u8865\u5168\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u4e0b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u51c6\u5219\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u6267\u884c\u6293\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6293\u53d6\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6293\u53d6\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8865\u5168\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u8349\u8393\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u5f03\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u6293\u53d6\u3002"}}

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u5524\u9192\u65b9\u6cd5LURE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u91cd\u5524\u9192\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLURE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u53bb\u566a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1b3\uff09\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u786e\u4fdd\u91cd\u5524\u9192\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLURE\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u64e6\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u591a\u4e2a\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "LURE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u5524\u9192\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial.

Especially for tasks involving rich physical interactions, relying solely on visual observations and robot proprioceptive information often fails to reveal the underlying event transitions. This raises the requirement for efficient collection of high-quality multi-modal data as well as robust segmentation method to decompose demonstrations into meaningful modules. Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86TacUMI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u7f06\u5b89\u88c5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u4e30\u5bcc\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5e95\u5c42\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6f14\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u6301\u6f14\u793a\u8bbe\u5907UMI\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1TacUMI\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210ViTac\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u529b-\u529b\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u517c\u5bb9\u5939\u722a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u987a\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u7535\u7f06\u5b89\u88c5\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TacUMI\u4e3a\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f14\u793a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "TacUMI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoM\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u94fe\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u7ec7\u68c0\u7d22\u7247\u6bb5\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6784\u5efa\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62fc\u63a5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u68c0\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662fChain-of-Memory\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u7247\u6bb5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u622a\u65ad\u6765\u526a\u679d\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongMemEval\u548cLoCoMo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoM\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477.5%-10.4%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff1atoken\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u81f3\u7ea62.7%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u81f3\u7ea66.0%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "CoM\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\\%$ detection rate.

This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4ee5\u8ffd\u6c42\u6548\u7387\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c0f\u578bVLMs\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u4e0e\u4eba\u7ade\u4e89\u3001\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ade\u4e89\u3001\u4e0e\u8fc7\u53bb\u81ea\u6211\u7ade\u4e89\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u5408\u89c4\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "1. \u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GPT-4o\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7ade\u4e89\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fc7\u53bb\u81ea\u6211\u7ade\u4e89\u6700\u5f3a\u30022. \u4e0d\u5f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u5982\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u30023. \u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u8868\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578bVLMs\u65f6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAEP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9MoE LLMs\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e13\u5bb6\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "MoE LLMs\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f83\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLayer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u526a\u679d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8de8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLAEP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u4ece\u5934\u9884\u8bad\u7ec31010B Base\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534748.3%\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1133.3%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LAEP\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3MoE LLMs\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u526a\u679d\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We adopt a system-level bio-inspired design: a high-level model plans goals, an adaptive cerebellum module stabilizes motion using high-frequency sensors feedback, and a bio-inspired spinal layer executes lightning-fast actions generation. NeuroVLA represents the first deployment of a neuromorphic VLA on physical robotics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues.

However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eff\u4eba\u8db3\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u90e8\u9aa8\u9abc\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5782\u76f4\u4e0b\u843d\u88c5\u7f6e\u7814\u7a76\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c38\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u96be\u4ee5\u91cd\u590d\u63a2\u6d4b\u7740\u9646\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u59ff\u52bf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7740\u9646\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u672a\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4eff\u751f\u8db3\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4eff\u4eba\u8db3\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u90e8\u9aa8\u9abc\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5782\u76f4\u4e0b\u843d\u88c5\u7f6e\u6a21\u62df\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4eff\u4eba\u7ed3\u6784\u6bd4\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u521a\u6027\u8db3\u90e8\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u6bd4\u3002\u8e1d\u5173\u8282\u80cc\u5c48\u548c\u811a\u8dbe\u4f38\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u963b\u5c3c\u6bd4\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u62f1\u5f62\u591a\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u68b0\u8db3\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u8870\u51cf\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62f1\u5f62\u591a\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u51b2\u51fb\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u59ff\u52bf\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u56de\u5f39\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7740\u9646\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9aa8\u9abc\u590d\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u52bf\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.\n  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters.

Additionally, the models trained in one domain are not applicable to other domains, necessitating the need for cross-domain adaptation (such as HDFS and Linux). Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality.

Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies.

Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation.

However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiSPA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5316\u5b66\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u901a\u8def\u6c34\u5e73\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a71\u52a8\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728GDSC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u5316\u5b66\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u901a\u8def\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u4ec5\u5728\u540e\u671f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u836f\u7269\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "DiSPA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5316\u5b66\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u901a\u8def\u6c34\u5e73\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6765\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u8026\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u7684\u901a\u8def-\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u653e\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728GDSC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cDiSPA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u89c1\u836f\u7269-\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u836f\u6548\u56e2\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u7269\u901a\u8def\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528bulk RNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684DiSPA\u80fd\u591f\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u836f\u7269\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "DiSPA\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6574\u5408\u836f\u7269\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u539f\u7406\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \\textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \\emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VJEPA\u662fJEPA\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5316\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0ePSR/\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709JEPA\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6982\u7387\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVJEPA\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u63d0\u51faBJEPA\uff1a\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e58\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eVJEPA\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u907f\u514d\u8868\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVJEPA/BJEPA\u80fd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8868\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "VJEPA\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u6784\u9020\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAS-Mamba\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d-\u5e45\u5ea6-\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9891\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u4f53\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\u6240\u643a\u5e26\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u6839\u636e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4f7f\u7528LocalMamba\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4ee5\u9510\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2. \u5728\u9891\u57df\u5c06\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u652f\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u9891\u57df\u626b\u63cf\uff08CFDS\uff09\u4ece\u4f4e\u9891\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u57df\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08DDCFM\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5e45\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u57df\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728IXI\u548cfastMRI\u819d\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9891\u57df\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy. Together, these results establish a scalable platform for multifunctional soft robotic catheters and a new paradigm for complex endoluminal interventions, with potential to reduce radiation exposure, shorten training, and accelerate clinical translation of soft robotic technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u5f841.47\u6beb\u7c73\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u7ba1\uff0c\u96c6\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u529f\u80fd\u4e8e\u4e00\u4f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u8154\u5185\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728ERCP\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u80f0\u817a\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5185\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5668\u68b0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c16\u7aef\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u754c\u9762\u53cd\u9988\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u6a21\u5757\u4e0d\u591f\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8154\u5185\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u7ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6700\u591a\u56db\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5355\u5143\uff08\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u9776\u5411\u7ed9\u836f\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u4e3b/\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u677f\u8f7d\u5f62\u72b6\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d3b\u4f53\u732a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u534a\u81ea\u4e3b\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u80f0\u817a\u5bfc\u7ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e867.5\u5398\u7c73\u7684\u5185\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\uff08\u8fd9\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u5bfc\u7ba1\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff09\u3002\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d2\u7ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u8154\u5185\u4ecb\u5165\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u3001\u7f29\u77ed\u57f9\u8bad\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u3002"}}

Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -timing, intensity, and offset- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u7279(p-bit)\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5668\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u53d8\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u7528\u78c1\u96a7\u9053\u7ed3(MTJ)\u7b49\u65b0\u5174\u5668\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0p-bit\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u5668\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5668\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f02\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u771f\u5b9e\u5668\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCUDA\u7684GPU\u52a0\u901f\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfp-bit\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u5f02\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u65f6\u5e8f\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u504f\u79fb\u53d8\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728MAX-CUT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece800\u523020,000\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u6bd4CPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u610f\u5916\u53d1\u73b0\u5668\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u53d8\u5f02\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5668\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5668\u4ef6\u53d8\u5f02\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7535\u7f06\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08\u5982\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u624b\u773c\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7535\u7f06\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bfb\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u624b\u672f\u6210\u529f", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u5757\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u548c\u624b\u773c\u6821\u51c6\u5757\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\uff09", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u7f06\u9a71\u52a8\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u4f18\u52bf"}}

While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI.

We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSR-HINE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u9690\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u901f\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u5584\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u8bef\u5dee\u5feb\u901f\u653e\u5927\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u6f14\u548c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "MSR-HINE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u9690\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u901f\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u7ec6\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u540e\u9a8c\u6f5c\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6821\u6b63\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u5faa\u73af\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMSR-HINE\u76f8\u6bd4U-Net\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1a\u5728Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ec8\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684RMSE\u964d\u4f4e62.8%\uff08H=400\uff09\uff0cACC\u4ece-0.155\u63d0\u5347\u52300.828\uff1b\u5728Lorenz-96\u4e0a\uff0cRMSE\u964d\u4f4e27.0%\uff08H=100\uff09\uff0cACC\u4ece0.144\u63d0\u5347\u52300.545\u3002ACC\u22650.5\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8303\u56f4\u5206\u522b\u4ece241\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230400\u6b65\uff0c\u4ece58\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230100\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "MSR-HINE\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6162\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5feb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6df7\u6c8c\u63a8\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper introduces HumanoidVLM, a vision-language driven retrieval framework that enables the Unitree G1 humanoid to select task-appropriate Cartesian impedance parameters and gripper configurations directly from an egocentric RGB image. The system couples a vision-language model for semantic task inference with a FAISS-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves experimentally validated stiffness-damping pairs and object-specific grasp angles from two custom databases, and executes them through a task-space impedance controller for compliant manipulation. We evaluate HumanoidVLM on 14 visual scenarios and achieve a retrieval accuracy of 93%. Real-world experiments show stable interaction dynamics, with z-axis tracking errors typically within 1-3.5 cm and virtual forces consistent with task-dependent impedance settings.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion.

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8PINNs\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "PDE\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06PINNs\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5176\u4e2d\u3002\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec0\u4e48\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8de8\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u644a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u6311\u6218\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60PDE\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Edge intelligence within 6G, particularly Open RAN and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), offers a pathway to address these challenges by bringing computation closer to the data source. This work investigates the deployment of VLMs on ORAN/MEC infrastructure using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot as an embodied testbed. We design a WebRTC-based pipeline that streams multimodal data to an edge node and evaluate LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct deployed at the edge versus in the cloud under real-time conditions. Our results show that edge deployment preserves near-cloud accuracy while reducing end-to-end latency by 5\\%.

Linking Adversarial and Statistical Robustness", "comment": null, "summary": "Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $\u03ba$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u566a\u58f0\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u76f8\u540c\u5e45\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u56e0\u5b50\u03ba\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u9879\u540c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u548cCIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u566a\u58f0\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIDAL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea69Hz\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u8bed\u4e49\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u9891\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6267\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6267\u884c\u76f2\u533a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5f00\u73af\u6267\u884c\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u79fb\u52a8\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "TIDAL\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9891\u7387\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f4e\u9891\u5b8f\u610f\u56fe\u5faa\u73af\u7f13\u5b58\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u5c06\u5355\u6b65\u6d41\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u9519\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8ba9\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u8865\u507f\u3002\u8fd8\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea69Hz\u63a7\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a2.4Hz\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u62e6\u622a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472\u500d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u9759\u6001\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u9988\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89c6\u91ce\u8d85\u51fa\u539f\u751f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u5728\u975e\u6682\u505c\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0cTIDAL\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u56e0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TIDAL\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8fb9\u9645\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC.

We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51farunway-aware rewiring\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5e03\u7ebf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u5176runway\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8868\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7531\u4e2d\u95f4token\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u67d0\u4e9b\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea7\u8054\u5230token\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5df2\u5145\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51farunway-aware rewiring\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684runway\u73af\u5883\u6458\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5e03\u7ebf\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06runway\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f4\u63a5\u7eb3\u5165\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7ftoken\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5e03\u7ebf\u7684Transformer\u5728\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7runway-aware rewiring\u673a\u5236\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5c06runway\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7eb3\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction.

Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation.

Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker \"Implications\" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed \"Implications\" and approached the strongest human-designed \"Rewrite\" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability.

However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$\u03c9$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $\u03c9= \u03bav$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods.

This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset.

As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u78b0\u649e\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u91cd\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u65b0\u78b0\u649e\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u78b0\u649e\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u914d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u51fd\u6570", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u81ea\u7136\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f66\u8f86\u7ed5\u5f00\u5176\u4ed6\u4ea4\u901a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb"}}

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability.

Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQMC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u65b0\u5174\u975e\u6613\u5931\u6027\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5QMC\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5185\u70b9\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u591a\u7ea7ReRAM\u4e2d\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6MRAM\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cQMC\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c116.3-7.3\u500d\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u51cf\u5c117.6\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e11.7\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e12.5\u500d", "conclusion": "QMC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process.

Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Forest-Chat\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u4f46\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff08RSICI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u975e\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForest-Chat\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff08MCI\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7f16\u6392\uff1b2\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u754c\u9762\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b4\uff09\u521b\u5efaForest-Change\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0", "result": "Forest-Chat\u5728Forest-Change\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cLEVIR-MCI-Trees\uff08LEVIR-MCI\u7684\u6811\u6728\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u9a71\u52a8RSICI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "conclusion": "Forest-Chat\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u68ee\u6797\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Plummer", "Chandra Sekharudu", "Deepak Warrier", "Mohammad Yekrangian"], "title": "Constructing Multi-label Hierarchical Classification Models for MITRE ATT&CK Text Tagging", "comment": null, "summary": "MITRE ATT&CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level.

To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses.

Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\\% in accuracy and 1.26\\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "READ-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u60c5\u611f\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u542c\u6291\u90c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6291\u90c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5ffd\u89c6\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f1a\u9519\u8fc7\u6291\u90c1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u7eb3\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u53c8\u5bb9\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u77ed\u6682\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREAD-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6821\u51c6(AFR)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6291\u90c1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u60c5\u611f\u566a\u58f0", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cREAD-Net\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.55%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53471.26%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "READ-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u60c5\u611f\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u89c6\u542c\u6291\u90c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module.

Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5236\u9acb\u90e8\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u8f85\u52a9\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6b65\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\u95f4\u53c2\u6570", "motivation": "\u8dcc\u5012\u5bf9\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u5065\u5eb7\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u591a\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u800c\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u8f85\u52a9\u6539\u5584\u6b65\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u4fa7\u9acb\u90e8\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5236\u8f85\u52a9\u529b\u77e9\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u57288\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6ed1\u5012\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8eab\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "result": "\u8f85\u52a9\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u51b3\u5b9a\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u51cf\u5c1125.7%\u7684WBAM\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6b65\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8c03\u6574"}}

This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning \"future\" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark.

Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.\n  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4\u3001BioMistral-7B\u3001LLaMA-3.1-8B\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u66f4\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u672c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6539\u53d8\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\uff081\uff09\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u9632\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff082\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u9700\u8981\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI-READI\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-4\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caBioMistral-7B\u548cLLaMA-3.1-8B\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u5e72\u9884\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5e76\u4e0eDiCE\u3001CFNOW\u3001NICE\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLLaMA-3.1-8B\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe99%\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe0.99\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747F1\u6062\u590d20%\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u65e2\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002SenseCF\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice.

To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., \"get ready for work\") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out \"silent failures\" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-CAGE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u89e3\u8fde\u63a5\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ecf\u5e38\"\u6210\u529f\"\u4f46\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6307\u4ee4\u9700\u8981\u63a5\u5730\u5230\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ece\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5177\u8eab\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "V-CAGE\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u7981\u6b62\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u5730\u56fe\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u7269\u4f53\u7a7f\u900f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u8fbe\u4e14\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b2) \u5206\u5c42\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u57fa\u5143\uff1b3) VLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u6267\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\"\u9759\u9ed8\u5931\u8d25\"\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cV-CAGE\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u672a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "V-CAGE\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u64cd\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This review summarises modern techniques by examining architectural innovations, generative model integration, and the use of temporal information to enhance robustness and accuracy. Unlike earlier surveys, it classifies methods based on core architectures, data processing strategies, and surveillance specific challenges such as dynamic environments, occlusions, lighting variations, and real-time requirements. The primary goal is to evaluate the current effectiveness of semantic object detection, while secondary aims include analysing deep learning models and their practical applications.

Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines.

It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MonoRace\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cIMU\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u57282025\u5e74\u963f\u5e03\u624e\u6bd4\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u51fb\u8d25\u4e86\u6240\u6709AI\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u4e09\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u754c\u51a0\u519b\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe100\u516c\u91cc/\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u76ee\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cIMU\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cIMU\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u7528\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "1. \u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u95e8\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\n2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u95e8\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u98de\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\n3. \u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u63a5\u53d1\u9001\u7535\u673a\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5185\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\u4ee5500Hz\u8fd0\u884c", "result": "\u57282025\u5e74\u963f\u5e03\u624e\u6bd4\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u80dc\uff0c\u51fb\u8d25\u4e86\u6240\u6709AI\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u4e09\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u754c\u51a0\u519b\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b0\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe100\u516c\u91cc/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u5bf9\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5e72\u6270\u548cIMU\u9971\u548c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "MonoRace\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cIMU\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7ade\u8d5b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u817a\u764c\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(DANN)\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u67d3\u8272\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5219\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u764c\u75c7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u5668\u5b98\u7684\u817a\u764c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c06\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528ResNet50\u8bc4\u4f30\u80ba\u3001\u7ed3\u80a0\u3001\u4e73\u817a\u548c\u80be\u817a\u764c\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\n2. \u5c06ResNet50\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(DANN)\u8fdb\u884c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\n3. \u7814\u7a76\u67d3\u8272\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5bf9\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\n4. \u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790DANN\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f52\u56e0", "result": "1.

While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.\n  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations.

While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness.

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems.

Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u7259\u79d1\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u853d\u672f\u540eCBCT\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RegFreeNet\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1a\u624b\u672f\u5bfc\u677f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u51fa\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672f\u524d\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u626b\u63cf\u672f\u540e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u51c6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u672f\u524d\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u533b\u9662\u90fd\u6709\u914d\u5bf9\u7684CBCT\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u853d\u672f\u540eCBCT\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u4efb\u4f55\u5305\u542b\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u7684CBCT\u90fd\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ImplantFairy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1622\u4e2aCBCT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea73D\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86RegFreeNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u90bb\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5(NDP)\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u7259\u9f7f\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u5761\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImplantFairy\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RegFreeNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u914d\u51c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7259\u79d1\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To appear in The Web Conference 2026", "summary": "Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks.

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations.

Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGRL-SR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u62df\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5019\u9009\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u540e\u89c1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\uff0c\u8ba9\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168\u70b9\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u641c\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEGRL-SR\u5728\u6062\u590d\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "EGRL-SR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u3002"}}

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content.

To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework.

However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERMES\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7406\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4f4eGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c01\u88c5\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6d41\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTTFT\u63d0\u534710\u500d\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a68%\u89c6\u9891token\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad811.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HERMES\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u65f6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Wu", "Otto Ritter", "Bingjia Yang", "Xiang Yu"], "title": "Case-Guided Sequential Assay Planning in Drug Discovery", "comment": null, "summary": "Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner.

Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "VoidFace\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u70b9\u7834\u574f\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u591a\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u6539\u7f16\u800c\u6765\uff09\u5bf9\u6b64\u65e0\u6548\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u89c6\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u8eab\u4efd\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u70b9\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u53d1\u7ea7\u8054\u7834\u574f\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7834\u574f\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u64e6\u9664\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u7269\u7406\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u57df\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5207\u65ad\u8eab\u4efd\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e2d\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6e90\u8eab\u4efd\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVoidFace\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u4eba\u8138\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "VoidFace\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u3002"}}

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u52a0\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e33%\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u578b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u6570\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u533a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u524d\u666f\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u578b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8\u6548\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u62fc\u63a5\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8633%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210-\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "FSX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684GNN\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6d88\u606f\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7ed3\u6784\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u504f\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FSX\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6d88\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u5c40\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u6270\u52a8\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d88\u606f\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6392\u540d\u7684\u6d41\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u56fe\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7bShapley\u503c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u8282\u70b9\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5176\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u7834\u574f\u5173\u952e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGNN\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cFSX\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7ed3\u6784\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u2014\u2014\u5177\u4f53\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5173\u952e\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u65bd\u52a0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "FSX\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709GNN\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u6d88\u606f\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3GNN\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization.

Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RefProtoFL \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6982\u7387\u66f4\u65b0\u4e22\u5f03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u539f\u578b\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u79c1\u6709\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u901a\u4fe1\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6982\u7387\u66f4\u65b0\u4e22\u5f03\uff08APUD\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e45\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684Top-K\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08ERPA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6301\u6709\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u539f\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRefProtoFL\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RefProtoFL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ERPA\u548cAPUD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7535\u8def\u91cd\u8fde\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u6574\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u91cd\u65b0\u5305\u88c5\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\"\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u53d8\"\uff1a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\uff0cMDM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u653e\u5f03\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8fde\u63a5\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\uff0c\u4eceARM\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u5c40\u90e8\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3aMDM\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u91cd\u7ec4\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining.

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5f02\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u968f\u65f6\u5b8c\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u3001\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u524d\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6811\u5f80\u5f80\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982C4.5\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5f02\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u968f\u65f6\u5b8c\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u52aa\u529b\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5730\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u50cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u90a3\u6837\u5148\u5b8c\u5168\u4f18\u5316\u5de6\u5b50\u6811\u518d\u63a2\u7d22\u53f3\u5b50\u6811\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u4e2d\u65ad\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5f02\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u968f\u65f6\u5b8c\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u533b\u7597VLMs\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u975e\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53e0\u52a0\u6587\u672c\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u533b\u7597VLMs\u88ab\u671f\u671b\u6355\u6349\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u75c5\u7076\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533b\u7597VLMs\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u975e\u533b\u7597VLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u7597VLMs\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u5982LLM2CLIP\uff09\u7684\u975e\u533b\u7597VLMs\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002\u975e\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u522b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53e0\u52a0\u6587\u672c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u533b\u7597VLMs\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u80cc\u666f\u504f\u5dee\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edcM2I2HA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4bSOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002CNN\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0cTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0cSSM\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u626b\u63cf\u673a\u5236\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM2I2HA\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a1) \u6a21\u6001\u5185\u8d85\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u8d85\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u6865\u63a5\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u878d\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) M2-FullPAD\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cM2I2HA\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7406\u8bba\u7684M2I2HA\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u597d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u6559\u5b66\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6559\u5e08\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u751f-\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u6559\u5e08-\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u82cf\u683c\u62c9\u5e95\u5f0f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u505c\u6b62\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u8fed\u4ee3\uff1b\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8bae\u6bd4\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177"}}

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates.

However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns.

This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping.

For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniRoute\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u540c\u8d28/\u5f02\u8d28\uff09\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5411\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u540c\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u50cf\u7d20\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u5f02\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6291\u5236\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRoute\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) AR2-MoE\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u8026\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b2) MDR-MoE\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u878d\u5408\u539f\u8bed\uff1b3) CASD\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u591a\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5f02\u8d28\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniRoute\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6709\u5229\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "UniRoute\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "UBATrack\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7aMamba\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRGB-T\u3001RGB-D\u548cRGB-E\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUBATrack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u65f6\u7a7aMamba\u9002\u914d\u5668(STMA)\uff0c\u5229\u7528Mamba\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728LasHeR\u3001RGBT234\u3001RGBT210\u3001DepthTrack\u3001VOT-RGBD22\u548cVisEvent\u7b49RGB-T\u3001RGB-D\u548cRGB-E\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UBATrack\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A Systematic Study", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faReasoning-QAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001token\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316(PTQ)\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3(QAT)\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1)\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2)PTQ\u4f5c\u4e3aQAT\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b3)\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b4)\u5bf9\u9f50PTQ\u6821\u51c6\u57df\u548cQAT\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u3002\u6574\u5408\u4e3aReasoning-QAT\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "Reasoning-QAT\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728Qwen3-0.6B\u4e0a\uff0cMATH-500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4GPTQ\u63d0\u534744.53%\uff0c\u57282\u6bd4\u7279\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684QAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these approaches often neglect the patch's location within the global volume, which can limit segmentation performance when anatomical context is important.

Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing.

We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics.

To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods.

Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\u03c7$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches.

However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1) \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u65e0\u7ebf\u94fe\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff1b2) \u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u6267\u884c\u672c\u5730\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbe\u5907-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc1\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u6bcf\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u53ef\u9760\u805a\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u8870\u843d\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u989d\u5916\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728RGB-\u6df1\u5ea6\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance.

Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces.

However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows.

Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement.

Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration.

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "FG-Trac\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u627f\u8bfa\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u88ab\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bb0\u5f55\u662f\u5426\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "FG-Trac\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ffd\u8e2a\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u627f\u8bfa\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5373\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFG-Trac\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "FG-Trac\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002"}}

This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors.

One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups.

RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries.

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments.

To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{F}orcing for \\textbf{V}ideo \\textbf{F}rame \\textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u3001SoftMoE\u548cSparseMoE\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u786c\u4ef6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u672a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76MoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3MoE\u5728\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728CIFAR10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u3001SoftMoE\u548cSparseMoE\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u907f\u514d\u4e13\u5bb6\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u548c\u8ff9\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cdMoE\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e73\u8861\u5229\u7528\u3002SoftMoE\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548cSparseMoE\u5904\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u786c\u4ef6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u672a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7565\u5fae\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c16\u9510\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8868\u9762\u5206\u6790\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities.

Recently, it has been observed that FJS actually arises from consecutive label and covariate (or vice versa) shifts. Research into FJS so far has been confined to the case of categorical label spaces.

However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6LiViBench\uff0c\u5305\u542b24\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LiVi-LLM-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u4e92\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\u548c\u5f55\u5236\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u5305\u542b\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u8bba\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1LiViBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b24\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u76f4\u64ad\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u8bc4\u8bba\u68c0\u7d22\uff08VCR\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff1b4. \u5f00\u53d1LiVi-LLM-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "LiVi-LLM-7B\u5728LiViBench\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u8fbe72B\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5728\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\uff08VideoMME\u3001LongVideoBench\u3001MLVU\u3001VideoEval-Pro\uff09\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LiViBench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6(CB-DRL)\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8f66\u961f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7535\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u7684EVRPTW\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u4ec5\u5728N=10\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230N=5\u5230N=100\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd"}}

This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyNeA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u6545\u969c\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u800c\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u6709\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "HyNeA\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6545\u969c\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHyNeA\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6545\u969c\u6807\u8bb0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HyNeA\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7CAFEIN\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u673a\u6784\u534f\u4f5c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Transformer-GNN\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728BraTS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCAFEIN\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Transformer-GNN\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6e90\u81ea\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8d85\u4f53\u7d20GNN\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u673a\u6784\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728BraTS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5355\u673a\u6784\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u8fc7\u65e9\u505c\u6b62\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9T2\u548cFLAIR\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff08p<0.001\uff0cCohen's d=1.50\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u673a\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316GNN\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316GNN\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "GNN\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRAP\uff08\u4f4e\u79e9\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41QAT\u6846\u67b6\u548c9\u4e2a\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLoRAP\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316GNN\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f", "conclusion": "LoRAP\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684GNN\u91cf\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd"}}

We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics.

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process.

This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields.

However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage.

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPictorialCortex\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5fMRI\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u76ae\u5c42\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u540c\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u8bd5\u6b21\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\uff09\uff0cfMRI\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5355\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u65e0\u9700\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u91cd\u5efa\u672a\u89c1\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPictorialCortex\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u516c\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21fMRI\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u76ae\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3-\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u914d\u5bf9\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePictorialCortex\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u76ae\u5c42\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5fMRI\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence.

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops.

The final published version will be available via IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps.

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraSP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GraSP\uff08Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u7ed8\u5236\u65b9\u5f0f\u914d\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u7ed8\u5236\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "GraSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5de5\u4f5c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f5c\u8005\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u9009\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u6392\u540d\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5956\u9879\u8bc4\u9009\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u4f1a\u8bae\u6295\u7a3f\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\uff08\u5982NeurIPS\u3001ICML\u5e74\u6536\u6570\u4e07\u7bc7\uff09\uff0c\u7ed9\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u8bba\u6587\u5956\u9879\u8bc4\u9009\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Isotonic Mechanism\u8ba9\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6295\u7a3f\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6392\u540d\u8c03\u6574\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4f5c\u8005\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u51f8\u53ef\u52a0\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u8005\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5f53\u4f5c\u8005\u6548\u7528\u662f\u51f8\u53ef\u52a0\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6709\u52a8\u673a\u8bda\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\uff1b\u7279\u522b\u5f53\u4f5c\u8005\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u989d\uff08\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u540d\u4e00\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u4ec5\u4e3a\u975e\u9012\u51cf\u53ef\u52a0\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u4f7f\u7528ICLR\uff082019-2023\uff09\u548cNeurIPS\uff082021-2023\uff09\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u83b7\u5956\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u6700\u4f73\u8bba\u6587\u5956\u9879\u7684\u8bc4\u9009\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u83b7\u5956\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods.

Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "MolecularIQ\uff1a\u4e13\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u732e\u6216\u4ee3\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6216\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MolecularIQ\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u5316\u5b66\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3", "conclusion": "MolecularIQ\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55"}}

To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Progress-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5ProgressLM-3B\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u89c1\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fVLM\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faProgress-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30VLM\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2) \u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5(\u4f7f\u7528ProgressLM-45K\u6570\u636e\u96c6)\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b4) \u5bf914\u4e2aVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570VLM\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5ProgressLM-3B\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5c1a\u672a\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002ProgressLM-3B\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u529f\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D CT\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u9888\u690e\u9aa8\u6298\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u76842D\u6295\u5f71\u8fdb\u884c\u690e\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9aa8\u6298\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u9888\u690e\u9aa8\u6298\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u533b\u7597\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u690e\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\u57283D CT\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u690e\u9aa8\u7ea7\u9aa8\u6298\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u3001\u77e2\u72b6\u9762\u548c\u51a0\u72b6\u97622D\u6295\u5f71\u8fd1\u4f3c3D\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528YOLOv8\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c3D\u9888\u690e\u533a\u57df\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eDenseNet121-Unet\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02D\u5206\u5272\uff1b3. \u4ece2D\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c3D\u690e\u9aa8\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5355\u4e2a\u690e\u9aa8\u4f53\u79ef\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u539f\u59cb\u5207\u7247\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u76842.5D\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u6790\u9aa8\u6298\u3002", "result": "1. 3D mIoU\u8fbe\u523094.45%\uff1b2.

For code and dataset, see https://github.com/cvims/DrivIng", "summary": "Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night.

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.", "AI": {"tldr": "RayRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2Transformer\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u76843D\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1a1\uff09\u552f\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff1b2\uff09\u652f\u6301SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u5e95\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "RayRoPE\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c04\u7ebf\u8868\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u76843D\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u5c04\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5e27\u6295\u5f71\u5750\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u70b9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CO3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRayRoPE\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5728LPIPS\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9715%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408RGB-D\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6cd5\u7f16\u7801\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "RayRoPE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2Transformer\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u3001SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e14\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u57283D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \\eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86StableWorld\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u9a71\u9010\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7d2f\u79ef\u6f02\u79fb", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStableWorld\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u9a71\u9010\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9000\u5316\u5e27\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u5e27\uff0c\u4ece\u6e90\u5934\u9632\u6b62\u7d2f\u79ef\u6f02\u79fb", "result": "\u5728Matrix-Game\u3001Open-Oasis\u3001Hunyuan-GameCraft\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cStableWorld\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "StableWorld\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027"}}

Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources.

We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions.

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAPPLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u5986\u5bb9\uff09\u4fdd\u7559\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6761\u4ef6\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c5e\u6027\u9519\u4f4d", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAPPLE\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u589e\u5f3a\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u6559\u5e08\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4", "result": "APPLE\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff0cAPPLE\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362"}}
