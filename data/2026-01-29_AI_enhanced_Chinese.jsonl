However, existing human-in-the-loop RL (HiL-RL) frameworks often suffer from low sample efficiency, requiring substantial human interventions to achieve convergence and thereby leading to high labor costs. To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \\method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \\method achieves a 42.1\\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

The Motion Performance module balances manipulability and trajectory cost through dynamic switching, optimizing motion control while reducing the risk of singularities. Comparative analysis shows that JIT* consistently outperforms traditional sampling-based planners across $\\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{16}$ dimensions.

Project page at https://remac-async.github.io/", "summary": "Real-time execution is essential for cyber-physical systems such as robots. These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method enables faster task execution, maintains robustness across varying delays, and consistently achieves higher completion rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faREMAC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u7ea0\u6b63\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5757\u5185\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u6210\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u5757\u95f4\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5206\u5757\u5185\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u2014\u2014\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u5206\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREMAC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u7ea0\u6b63\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9762\u5bf9\u9884\u671f\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u524d\u7f00\u4fdd\u7559\u91c7\u6837\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5757\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "REMAC\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5757\u5185\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u5feb\u901f\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5047\u8bbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u786e\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5747\u503c\u548c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations.

Due to near-infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and heterogeneous patterns, existing vision-based affordance prediction methods often suffer from boundary overflow and fragmented functional regions. To address these issues, we propose TRACER, a Texture-Robust Affordance Chain-of-thought with dEformable-object Refinement framework, which establishes a cross-hierarchical mapping from hierarchical semantic reasoning to appearance-robust and physically consistent functional region refinement. Specifically, a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought (TA-CoT) is formulated to decompose high-level task intentions into hierarchical sub-task semantics, providing consistent guidance across various execution stages. To ensure spatial integrity, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement (SCBR) mechanism is introduced to suppress prediction spillover, guiding the perceptual response to converge toward authentic interaction manifolds. Furthermore, an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow (ICRF) is developed to aggregate discrete pixels corrupted by appearance noise, significantly enhancing the spatial continuity and physical plausibility of the identified functional regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic platform demonstrate that TRACER significantly improves affordance grounding precision across diverse textures and patterns inherent to deformable objects. More importantly, it enhances the success rate of long-horizon tasks, effectively bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level physical execution.

Existing approaches typically utilize vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for dense prediction. However, VLMs, pre-trained on image-text pairs, are biased toward salient, object-centric regions and exhibit two critical limitations when adapted to segmentation: (i) Foreground Bias, which tends to ignore background regions, and (ii) Limited Spatial Localization, resulting in blurred object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner. Additionally, we propose a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) that leverages pixel-wise spatial contexts and enables channel-wise feature refinement through multi-level updates.

To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data. Extensive experiments on five challenging contact-rich tasks, such as shoe lacing and chip handover, show that TouchGuide consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visuo-tactile policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "TouchGuide\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u7b56\u7565\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u878d\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cbe\u7ec6\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u611f\u5b98\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTouchGuide\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6216\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7565\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3CPM\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86TacUMI\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u521a\u6027\u6307\u5c16\u83b7\u53d6\u76f4\u63a5\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u978b\u5e26\u3001\u82af\u7247\u4ea4\u63a5\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTouchGuide\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TouchGuide\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8de8\u7b56\u7565\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u878d\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6TacUMI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cbe\u7ec6\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE), a framework that jointly optimizes masked image reconstruction and classification using both unlabeled and labeled samples with dynamically selected pseudo-labels. SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels).

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye).

Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Shallow-pi\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684Transformer\u5c42\u6570\uff08\u4ece18\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u52306\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc72\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52301%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8token\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684Transformer\u5c42\u51cf\u5c11\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShallow-pi\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5730\u51cf\u5c11VLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u7684Transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4ece18\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u52306\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc72\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52301%\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728Jetson Orin\u548cJetson Thor\u7b49\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Shallow-pi\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5c42\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.\n  We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities.

In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation.

However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone.

While several machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for nuclei instance segmentation, most research in this field focuses on developing new segmentation algorithms and benchmarking them on a limited number of arbitrarily selected public datasets.\n  In this work, rather than focusing on model development, we focused on the datasets used for this task. Based on an extensive literature review, we identified manually annotated, publicly available datasets of H&E-stained images for nuclei instance segmentation and standardized them into a unified input and annotation format. Using two state-of-the-art segmentation models, one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and one based on a hybrid CNN and vision transformer architecture, we systematically evaluated and ranked these datasets based on their nuclei instance segmentation performance. Furthermore, we proposed a unified test set (NucFuse-test) for fair cross-dataset evaluation and a unified training set (NucFuse-train) for improved segmentation performance by merging images from multiple datasets.\n  By evaluating and ranking the datasets, performing comprehensive analyses, generating fused datasets, conducting external validation, and making our implementation publicly available, we provided a new benchmark for training, testing, and evaluating nuclei instance segmentation models on H&E-stained histological images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709H&E\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6392\u540d\u548c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6NucFuse-test\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6NucFuse-train\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684H&E\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bc6\u522b\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2) \u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u683c\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cdSOTA\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff08CNN\u548cCNN-ViT\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6NucFuse-test\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b5) \u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6NucFuse-train\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd", "result": "1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6392\u540d\u4e86\u5404\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6NucFuse-test\u548cNucFuse-train\uff1b3) \u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b4) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3aH&E\u67d3\u8272\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56fe\u50cf\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6838\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable \"concept basins\" to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs).

Fang", "Tiffany J. Hwu"], "title": "Demonstration-Free Robotic Control via LLM Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAP\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728ViDoRe\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7d22\u5f15\u5411\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ColPali\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u5b58\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u5411\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u5df2\u6d88\u6563", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStructural Anchor Pruning (SAP)\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u8865\u4e01\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Oracle Score Retention (OSR)\u534f\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u5728ViDoRe\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSAP\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7d22\u5f15\u5411\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1bOSR\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u951a\u70b9\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728", "conclusion": "SAP\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u951a\u70b9\u8865\u4e01\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5173\u952e"}}

However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment.

However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models. Across multiple benchmarks, our best configuration reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving an average of 95% task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5230\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1165%\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630195%\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LLaDA-V\uff09\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8303\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cLLaDA-V\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5230\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d7FastV\u542f\u53d1\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u70b9\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5230\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b2\uff09\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u8be5\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u5ef6\u7eed\u5230\u540e\u7eed\u6240\u6709\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0eLLaDA-V\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe65%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u4fdd\u630195%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548LLaDA-V\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We benchmark 21 widely used classifiers, including linear models, SVMs, tree ensembles (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM), and modern tabular neural and foundation models, on binary tasks from the TabArena-v0.1 suite using randomized, stratified five-fold cross-validation with a held-out test fold. Five calibrators; Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify are trained on a separate calibration split and applied to test predictions. Calibration is evaluated using proper scoring rules (log-loss and Brier score) and diagnostic measures (Spiegelhalter's Z, ECE, and ECI), alongside discrimination (AUC-ROC) and standard classification metrics. Across tasks and architectures, Venn-Abers predictors achieve the largest average reductions in log-loss, followed closely by Beta calibration, while Platt scaling exhibits weaker and less consistent effects. Beta calibration improves log-loss most frequently across tasks, whereas Venn-Abers displays fewer instances of extreme degradation and slightly more instances of extreme improvement. Importantly, we find that commonly used calibration procedures, most notably Platt scaling and isotonic regression, can systematically degrade proper scoring performance for strong modern tabular models. Overall classification performance is often preserved, but calibration effects vary substantially across datasets and architectures, and no method dominates uniformly.

We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy. This staged learning prevents degenerate slot formation and preserves semantic consistency while aligning perception with task objectives. Experiments on object discovery benchmarks and simulated manipulation tasks show that STORM improves generalization to visual distractors, and control performance compared to directly using frozen foundation model features or training object-centric representations end-to-end.

In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality.

Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments. Overall, we propose this framework as a common evaluation standard enabling consistent, goal-oriented comparison of multi-robot field trials and supporting systematic development of robotic systems for future planetary exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316KPI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6708\u7403\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52d8\u63a2\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u5730\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6708\u7403\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52d8\u63a2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u5730\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u5730\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6708\u7403\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316KPI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684KPI\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u5411\u7684KPI\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5ba4\u5916\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u5730\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u884c\u661f\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8239\u4f53\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8239\u8236\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u6c34\u5458\u68c0\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5371\u9669\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u521d\u7ea7\u4ea7\u4e1a\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6c61\u635f\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ea7\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff08\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6784\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5272\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling.

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation.

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "DenseGRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eODE\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u76ca\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6574\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDenseGRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7ODE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u76ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5747\u5300\u63a2\u7d22\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0e\u65f6\u53d8\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574SDE\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DenseGRPO\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "DenseGRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality.

However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings.

To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset.

However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates.

To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction.

This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach. The estimated joint angles are then employed for closed-loop control through a Jacobian-based proportional-integral (PI) controller augmented with a feedforward term, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing.

When used to augment authentic data in Deep Metric Learning (DML), these synthetic samples enhance intra-class diversity and improve the performance of downstream DML tasks. We introduce BLenDeR, a diffusion sampling method designed to increase intra-class diversity for DML in a controllable way by leveraging set-theory inspired union and intersection operations on denoising residuals. The union operation encourages any attribute present across multiple prompts, while the intersection extracts the common direction through a principal component surrogate.

To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u88ab\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPerturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6270\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "PIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u662f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "PIL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves. In a within-subject user study (N=8), the learned agent reduces overall NASA-TLX workload by 77.1% relative to the simple steady-hand assistance baseline.

However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfSAE\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\"\u5206\u88c2\u5b57\u5178\"\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5982CLIP\u3001CLAP\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\"\u5206\u88c2\u5b57\u5178\"\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u53ea\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684SAE\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5df2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u88c2\u5b57\u5178\u5206\u89e3\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b58\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u975e\u5206\u88c2\u5b57\u5178\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5178\u3002", "result": "\u5728CLIP\uff08\u56fe\u50cf/\u6587\u672c\uff09\u548cCLAP\uff08\u97f3\u9891/\u6587\u672c\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6SAE\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\"\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\"\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space.

Standard neural networks typically treat features as independent entities, failing to exploit the inherent manifold structural dependencies that define tabular distributions. We propose Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN), a novel architecture that imposes a Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via a differentiable structural prior. StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing \"laws\" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "StructuralCFN\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStructuralCFN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6fc0\u6d3b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u6291\u5236\u6781\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u768410\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982\u8840\u6db2\u8f93\u8840\u3001\u81ed\u6c27\u3001WDBC\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4ec5\u4e3a300-2500\u4e2a\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c0f10-20\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "StructuralCFN\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\"\u5b9a\u5f8b\"\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data.

Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts.

However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions.

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms).

However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faC-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06SAM\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u63a9\u7801\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u80fd\u63d0\u5347DNN\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a1\uff09\u526a\u679dSAM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u526a\u679d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u526a\u679d\u540e\u5e94\u7528SAM\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5f0f\u9020\u6210\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6270\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u63a9\u7801\uff08\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CelebA-HQ\u3001Flowers-102\u548cCIFAR-10-C\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-18\u3001GoogLeNet\u548cMobileNet-V2\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cC-SAM\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe42%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u672a\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "C-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u63a9\u7801\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefDNN\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.\n  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.\n  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability.

In this work, we developed and externally validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations. These results suggest that longitudinal routine clinical markers can estimate short-horizon mortality risk in mCRPC and support proactive care planning over a multi-month window.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u53bb\u52bf\u62b5\u6297\u6027\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u8005180\u5929\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGRU\u548cRSF\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u5982BMI\u548c\u6536\u7f29\u538b\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u53bb\u52bf\u62b5\u6297\u6027\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u9884\u540e\u5dee\u4e14\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u77ed\u671f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e3b\u52a8\u62a4\u7406\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2aIII\u671f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u961f\u5217\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bbf\u89c6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684180\u5929\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86LSTM\u3001GRU\u3001Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u968f\u673a\u751f\u5b58\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u4e94\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf180\u5929\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u8bbf\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "GRU\u548cRSF\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff08C-index\u5747\u4e3a87%\uff09\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0cGRU\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u66f4\u597d\uff08\u659c\u73870.93\uff0c\u622a\u8ddd0.07\uff09\uff0cPR-AUC\u8fbe0.87\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u771f\u9633\u6027\u4e2d\u4f4d\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a151.0\u5929\uff0c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u4e3a59.0\u5929\u3002BMI\u548c\u6536\u7f29\u538b\u88ab\u786e\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u8054\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eb5\u5411\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1mCRPC\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u6570\u6708\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u62a4\u7406\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision.

However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSLDM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u9020\u5f71\u5242CT\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u5e38\u5242\u91cf\u9020\u5f71\u5242CT\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9020\u5f71\u5242\u7528\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7898\u9020\u5f71\u5242(ICM)\u8fc7\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80be\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u8fc7\u654f\u53cd\u5e94\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b(SLDM)\uff1a1) \u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3) \u5e94\u7528\u51cf\u5f71\u8840\u7ba1\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u5584\u9020\u5f71\u5242\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u9020\u5f71\u5242CT\u8840\u7ba1\u9020\u5f71\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SLDM\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u534f\u540c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684CT\u9020\u5f71\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u9020\u5f71\u5242\u5242\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{\u0394h}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{\u0394h}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain. Further improvements are anticipated through constraint relaxation and surrogate development, constituting an ongoing area of investigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u70ed\u7ba1\u5fae\u5806\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528PEARL\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u68d2\u79ef\u5206\u5cf0\u503c\u56e0\u5b50\u548cLCOE\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316LCOE\u7684\u56db\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u7ba1\u5fae\u5806\u662f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u6838\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316LCOE\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PEARL\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u68d2\u79ef\u5206\u5cf0\u503c\u56e0\u5b50\u548cLCOE\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u666f\uff1a\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u8f74\u5411\u548c\u9f13\u53cd\u5c04\u4f53\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8f74\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u4f53\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8f74\u5411\u548c\u9f13\u53cd\u5c04\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51cf\u5c0f\u56fa\u4f53\u6162\u5316\u5242\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u9488\u95f4\u8ddd\u548c\u9f13\u6d82\u5c42\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u71c3\u6599\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LCOE\u7684\u56db\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u8f74\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u63a7\u5236\u9f13\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7528\u77f3\u58a8\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684TRISO\u71c3\u6599\u3001\u6700\u5927\u5316\u71c3\u6599\u71c3\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "PEARL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u5904\u7406\u6743\u8861\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5168\u9636\u6a21\u62df\u95f4\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u3002"}}

Code will be released upon publication", "summary": "Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity.

While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1. It shows remarkable effectiveness and stability for models trained through multi-stage post-training pipelines, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and model merging, where traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) suffers from engineering complexity and training instability; 2. It is robust to data quality and coverage, enabling accuracy recovery without full training data.

Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDecision Importance Transformer (DIT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u6b21\u4f18\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(ICRL)\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u4ece\u6b21\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6b21\u4f18\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347RL\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6536\u96c6\u6b21\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5411\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aDIT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u6b21\u4f18\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "DIT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6b21\u4f18\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62dfactor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u65b0RL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift.

The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8ePyMC\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Facebook Prophet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u539f\u7248\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cAPI\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff08MCMC\u3001MAP\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u7528Facebook Prophet\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u7248\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u79cd\u5185\u7f6e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MAP\u548cMCMC\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e14\u5176API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8ePyMC\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0Prophet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168MCMC\u6280\u672f\u3001MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6536\u655b\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "PyMC-based\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u7248Prophet\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u548cAPI\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates.

Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "PalmBridge\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u96c6\u638c\u7eb9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u6df7\u5408\u6765\u6291\u5236\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u638c\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5c01\u95ed\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u663e\u8457\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPalmBridge\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u3002\u5728\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u51c6\u5219\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6620\u5c04\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u539f\u5411\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u3002\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u638c\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9aa8\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPalmBridge\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5185\u5f00\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4eEER\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u81f3\u9002\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PalmBridge\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u638c\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls.

These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density.

Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89d2\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u529fSSL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5dee\u5f02\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u5931\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u529fSSL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8c31\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u6709SSL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u5408\u7406\u548c\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "PASS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06must-link\u7ea6\u675f\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4f2a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6216\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002ML\u548cCL\u7ea6\u675f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u957f\u3002", "method": "PASS\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06must-link\u7ea6\u675f\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4f2a\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u6536\u96c6\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9\u548cCL\u8fdd\u53cd\u70b9\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6f\u5206\u914d\u540e\u9a8c\u7684Fisher-Rao\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPASS\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684SSE\uff08\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "PASS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction.

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. \"-ight\") or answer to a question (\"whale\") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62bc\u97f5\u8bd7\u6b4c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u662f\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5c0f\u81f31B\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u62bc\u97f5\u8bd7\u6b4c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u662f\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff08\u4ece1B\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u59cb\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u95f4token\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u64cd\u7eb5\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u62bc\u97f5\u8bcd\u6216\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches maintain these systems as independent silos, creating operational inefficiencies, delayed emergency responses, and increased management complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive dual-modality Internet of Things framework that seamlessly integrates RFID-based access control with multi-sensor environmental safety monitoring through a unified cloud architecture. The system comprises two coordinated subsystems: Subsystem 1 implements RFID authentication with servo-actuated gate control and real-time Google Sheets logging, while Subsystem 2 provides comprehensive safety monitoring incorporating flame detection, water flow measurement, LCD status display, and personnel identification. Both subsystems utilize ESP32 microcontrollers for edge processing and wireless connectivity. Experimental evaluation over 45 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: 99.2\\% RFID authentication accuracy with 0.82-second average response time, 98.5\\% flame detection reliability within 5-meter range, and 99.8\\% cloud data logging success rate.

However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study. We further conduct numerical tests on real datasets and demonstrate potential advantages of SSVM by working with locally nice solutions proposed in this paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SSVM\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SSVM\u662f0/1\u635f\u5931SVM\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u4e3ahSVM\u548crSVM\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55SSVM\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8ehSVM\u548crSVM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7a00\u758f\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SSVM\uff09\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u56e0\u57fa\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u51f8SVM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5728\u51f8SVM\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u2113\u2080\u8303\u6570\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4e3aSSVM\u5efa\u7acb\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0ehinge-loss SVM\uff08hSVM\uff09\u548cramp-loss SVM\uff08rSVM\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8bc1\u660eSSVM\u662f0/1\u635f\u5931SVM\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SSVM\u662f0/1\u635f\u5931SVM\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u6210\u7acb\u3002SSVM\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u4e3ahSVM\u548crSVM\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0chSVM\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5e8f\u5217\u6536\u655b\u52300/1\u635f\u5931SVM\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\uff0c\u4e140/1\u635f\u5931SVM\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u4e5f\u662frSVM\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aSSVM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8ehSVM\u548crSVM\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SSVM\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRepSFNet\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u6838\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528RepLK-ViT\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ASPP\u548cCAN\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728ShanghaiTech\u3001NWPU\u548cUCF-QNRF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "RepSFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This quantity probes the local geometry of the learned loss landscape and goes beyond forward-pass equivariance tests by directly assessing whether learning dynamics couple physically equivalent configurations. Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin. The result is a novel technique for evaluating if surrogate models have internalized symmetry properties of the known solution operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u662f\u5426\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u8026\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5185\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u76f8\u5173\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6cbf\u7740\u7fa4\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u8be5\u91cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8be5\u8bca\u65ad\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8f68\u9053\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u53d8\u6362\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f55\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u76c6\u5730\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u5185\u5316\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.", "AI": {"tldr": "HINT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u591a\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u4eba\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u4eba\u6570\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u4eba\u6570\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4eba\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\uff1b3) \u805a\u5408\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u5c40\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8de8\u7a97\u53e3\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4eba\u9645\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHINT\u4e0e\u5f3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728InterHuman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFID\u8fbe\u52303.100\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u76845.154\u3002", "conclusion": "HINT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u591a\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u4eba\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuraLSP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5de6\u5947\u5f02\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u79e9\u81a8\u80c0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad853%\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u56fe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u79e9\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NeuraLSP\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5de6\u5947\u5f02\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7b97\u5b50\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u79e9\u81a8\u80c0\u5177\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad853%\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684PDE\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuraLSP\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u79e9\u81a8\u80c0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures.

While simple retraining dynamics are known to converge linearly when the performative effects are weak ($\u03c1< 1$), the complexity in the regime $\u03c1> 1$ was hitherto open. In this paper, we establish a sharp phase transition: computing an $\u03b5$-performatively stable point is PPAD-complete -- and thus polynomial-time equivalent to Nash equilibria in general-sum games -- even when $\u03c1= 1 + O(\u03b5)$. This intractability persists even in the ostensibly simple setting with a quadratic loss function and linear distribution shifts. One of our key technical contributions is to extend this PPAD-hardness result to general convex domains, which is of broader interest in the complexity of variational inequalities.

Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability.

Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeRaDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\"\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "DeRaDiff\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cd\u5411\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5e03\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u9a8c\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeRaDiff\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "DeRaDiff\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u626b\u63cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types.

To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis. When varying different model dimensions trained at a fixed token budget, we find empirically that our parameterization enables reliable HP transfer across models from 51M to over 2B total parameters.

LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLatent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5267\u70c8\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u3002LTD\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e27\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u5e38\u89c4\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6VBench\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u805a\u7126\u7684VMBench\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VBench\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf3.31%\uff0c\u5728VMBench\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf3.58%\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LTD\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a \"total unfairness budget.\" For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec4\u5185\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7b49\u4e8e\"\u603b\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u7b97\"\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7acb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4e24\u8005\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u8bef\u89e3\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u7ec4\u5185\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u7ec4\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "1. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u603b\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u7b97\u7b49\u4e8e\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e58\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7ec4\u95f4\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2. \u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u603b\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\uff1b3. \u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8fdd\u89c4\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u5f53\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u6269\u5927\u603b\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u7b97\uff1b4. \u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u989d\u5916\u7ed3\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u7f13\u89e3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e92\u8865\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u7acb\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u81ea\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u521b\u9020\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faProFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7aef\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u6ee1\u8db3PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e25\u683c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "ProFlow\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1\uff09\u7ec8\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7aef\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c06\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u96c6\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u96c6\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u63d2\u503c\u6b65\uff0c\u5c06\u7cbe\u70bc\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u66f4\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u8fbe\u897f\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u7c98\u6027\u4f2f\u683c\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cProFlow\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "ProFlow\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u573a\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge.

To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation.

Existing adaptive discretization methods implicitly avoid suboptimal regions but do not provide explicit certificates of optimality or measurable progress guarantees. We introduce \\textbf{Certificate-Guided Pruning (CGP)}, which maintains an explicit \\emph{active set} $A_t$ of potentially optimal points via confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes.

In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6$\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5$O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u4f20\u8f93\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u4ece\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u5927\u5927\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b27\u62c9\u6b65\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\u4f20\u8f93\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u4ece\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7c7b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6cbf\u7ebf\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u5141\u8bb8\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u90e8Rademacher\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6$\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5$O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4e0e\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u90e8Rademacher\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u3001\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the \"Long-Context Tax\" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders (\"reasonable hesitation\"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power.

Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss.

We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints.

To address these, we propose C2, a novel framework enhancing DT with two core innovations: (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) via cross-attention to strengthen inter-sequence correlation modeling; (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) incorporating budget and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) constraints for selective learning of optimal trajectories. Extensive offline evaluations on the AuctionNet dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains (up to 3.23\\% over state-of-the-art GAVE) across diverse budget settings; ablation studies verify the complementary synergy of CLB and CL, confirming C2's superiority in auto-bidding.

A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR.

In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood.

What Works?", "comment": null, "summary": "Person Re-Identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in computer vision. This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets.

However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $\u03b4$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $\u03b4$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(\u03b4)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage. Our experiments across diverse backbones and datasets show that $\u03b4$-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration with negligible compute and no interface changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03b4-Adapter\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff1a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\"\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u03b4-Adapter\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a5\u53e3\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u5c0f\u6709\u754c\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5bf9\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0b\u964d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001O(\u03b4)\u6f02\u79fb\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u65f6\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u51c6\u5668\uff08\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u548c\u4fdd\u5f62\u6821\u6b63\u5668\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u03b4-Adapter\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u63a5\u53e3\u66f4\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03b4-Adapter\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\"\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u516c\u91cc\"\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction.

Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords.

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions.

Oraevsky", "Umberto Villa", "Mark A. Anastasio"], "title": "A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography", "comment": "Submitted to IEEE TMI", "summary": "Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework.

These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

Neves"], "title": "FD-MAD: Frequency-Domain Residual Analysis for Face Morphing Attack Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Face morphing attacks present a significant threat to face recognition systems used in electronic identity enrolment and border control, particularly in single-image morphing attack detection (S-MAD) scenarios where no trusted reference is available. In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features. These findings indicate that Fourier-domain residual modeling with structured regional fusion offers a competitive alternative to deep S-MAD architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u4eba\u8138\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u968f\u673a\u573a\u533a\u57df\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u7be1\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u4eba\u8138\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08S-MAD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u7be1\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\u9891\u7387\u57df\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u9891\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u7be1\u6539\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u968f\u673a\u573a\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u505a\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728FRLL-Morph\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747EER\u4e3a1.85%\uff0c\u5728MAD22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747EER\u4e3a6.12%\u3002\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5c31\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u6b8b\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533a\u57df\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6S-MAD\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u7be1\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7b49\u9884\u6d4b\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u7b49\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u9ad8405B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u6297\u6b3a\u9a97\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u7b49\u9884\u6d4b\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u76848B\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u6076\u610f\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u7b49\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cLLM-as-a-Judge\u5728\u9762\u5bf95-20\u500d\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4f1a\u5dee\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u7b49\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u62b5\u6297\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

This is the camera-ready version. Please refer to the published version for citation once available", "summary": "The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient.

However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations.

However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method.

We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space.

Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver.

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548ctoken\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u90fd\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u4e24\u5927\u6280\u672f\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u63a5\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u53cc\u5411\u6d1e\u5bdf\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684token\u6280\u672f\u5728MLLMs\u3001AIGC\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u50cf\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e00\u6837\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u901a\u7528token\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53Transformer\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u6781\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u76d1\u7763\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u53cd\u6620\u7269\u7406\u5371\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53Transformer\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u5e38\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528Kendall\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u548cJaccard\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\uff08SSM\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728NGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u6700\u5927\u6b8b\u5dee\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa388\u4e2a\u88ab\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5982\u6a2a\u5411\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5236\u52a8\u7b49\u5fae\u5999\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u53ef\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5371\u9669\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

We present FairT2V, a training-free debiasing framework for text-to-video generation that mitigates encoder-induced bias without finetuning. We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\n  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification.

However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate.

The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''.

However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684ROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e4b\u5916\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548cIMU\u6570\u636e\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165ROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u7528\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5148\u524dSOTA\u63d0\u53471.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001ROAD\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534711.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u3001\u5927\u96e8\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u9762\u8fc7\u6e21\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u578b\u76f8\u673a\u548cIMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that ScatterFusion outperforms other common methods, achieving significant reductions in error metrics across various prediction horizons.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScatterFusion\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u5c42\u6b21\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2)\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b3)\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b4)\u8d8b\u52bf-\u5b63\u8282-\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cScatterFusion\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "ScatterFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement.

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faConCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4eceLLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acbLLM\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08ConCA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758fConCA\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5148\u9a8c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8612\u79cd\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a00\u758fConCA\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SAEs\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0cConCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709SAEs\u66f4\u5177\u539f\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness hinges on an implicit assumption of local stationarity assumption, making them prone to errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series, especially when abrupt fluctuations occur, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring. To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from traffic, financial, energy, and weather domains show that TimeCatcher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations.

Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5e73\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5728XAI\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u786e\u4fdd\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5e73\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728XAI\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks.

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research.

CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test.

This paradigm is crucial in scenarios where evaluating individual classifier performance or understanding their strengths is challenging due to limited information. We propose a novel deep energy-based method for constructing an accurate meta-learner using only the predictions of individual learners, potentially capable of capturing complex dependence structures between them. Our approach requires no labeled data, learner features, or problem-specific information, and has theoretical guarantees for when learners are conditionally independent.

We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility.

While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods.

In dense mmWave environments, accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs as either inside authorized or restricted airspaces remains challenging, requiring models that handle complex propagation and signal variability. This paper proposes a deep learning model, referred to as CoBA, which stands for integrated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention which leverages Fifth Generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio measurements to classify UAV operations in authorized and restricted airspaces at low altitude. The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios. The model is evaluated against conventional ML models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark.

Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACFormer\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8865\u4e01\u6269\u5c55\u5c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u8d8b\u52bf\u65b9\u9762\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790CNN\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\"\u4e2a\u4f53\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\"\u6982\u5ff5\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1ACFormer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5171\u4eab\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8865\u4e01\u6269\u5c55\u5c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cACFormer\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "ACFormer\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u795e\u7ecfODE\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecfODE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6062\u590d\u5e95\u5c42\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u963b\u5c3c\u632f\u8361\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff08NODEs\uff09\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\uff08SR\uff09\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u5728\u4ec510%\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "1. \u795e\u7ecfODE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b2. \u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u9009\u62e9\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8610%\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u795e\u7ecfODE\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u4e30\u5bcc\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8ba9\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u65ad\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6062\u590d\u5168\u90e8\u65b9\u7a0b\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eAI\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u964c\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u6216\u6295\u7968\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u7a00\u91ca\u5355\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168AI\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76d1\u63a7\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u6301\u7eed\u89c2\u5bdf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\u5c06\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization.

However, existing methods either (i) optimize counterfactuals only for a fixed group and do not generalize to new group members, (ii) strictly rely on strong model assumptions (e.g., linearity) for tractability or/and (iii) poorly control the counterfactual group geometry distortion. We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...). Experiments show that they accurately generalize, preserve group geometry and incur only negligible additional transport cost compared to baseline methods.

This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\\widetilde{O}(H^2|\u039e|\\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines.

Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed. However, training these Cox models with high-dimensional features typically requires a substantial number of labeled samples containing information about time-to-event. The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model. In summary, the Cox-MT model effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to significantly enhance prediction accuracy compared to existing ANN-based Cox models trained solely on labeled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eMean Teacher\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u534a\u76d1\u7763Cox\u6a21\u578bCox-MT\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73b0\u6709ANN-based Cox\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\uff08\u5305\u542b\u751f\u5b58\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMean Teacher\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcCox\u6a21\u578b\uff08Cox-MT\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5728TCGA\u764c\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ecRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6a21\u6001Cox-MT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709Cox-nnet\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001Cox-MT\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Cox-MT\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcCox\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $\u03b1=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $\u03b1=1$. For non-convex objectives and $\u03b4$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((\u03b7,\u03b7_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $\u03c1_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase.

However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hestia\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u677e\u5f1b\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6e10\u8fdb\u786c\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528Hessian\u8ff9\u6307\u5bfc\u6e29\u5ea6\u9000\u706b\uff0c\u5728Llama-3.2\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e09\u5143\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u76f4\u901a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u8fc7\u65e9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHestia\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u7528\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684softmax\u677e\u5f1b\u66ff\u4ee3\u521a\u6027\u9636\u8dc3\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u6e10\u8fdb\u786c\u5316\u91cf\u5316\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7Hessian\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6e29\u5ea6\u9000\u706b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-3.2\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cHestia\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e09\u5143\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c1B\u548c3B\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u4e3a5.39%\u548c4.34%\uff0c\u8868\u660eHessian\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a1.58\u6bd4\u7279LLM\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "Hestia\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

Baker", "Alexander Denker", "Jes Frellsen"], "title": "Supervised Guidance Training for Infinite-Dimensional Diffusion Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces.

Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u7f13\u51b2\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u51cf\u5c11TD\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u76ee\u6807\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u7684TD\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5728OOD\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u533a\u7f13\u51b2\u91c7\u6837\uff08Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD, C^4\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u653e\u5206\u533a\u5185\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u6d88\u9664\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7f13\u51b2\u5206\u533a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u6781\u7aefOOD\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f3a\u8c03OOD\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3TD\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684C^4\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u60e9\u7f5a\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548cOOD\u533a\u57df\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $\u03b1$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with H\u00f6lder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e73\u6ed1\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u3002\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08\u4ec5\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\uff09\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u53d8\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u590d\u5236\uff08\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u5230\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff1b2\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u03b1\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u9762\u8fdb\u884cH\u00f6lder/Lipschitz\u63a7\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ec5\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u548cUCI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u526f\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u590d\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c06\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u590d\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e73\u6ed1\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u590d\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $\u03b5$ is close to optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u7b7e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7ea7\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e58\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u7b7e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u6b67\u7cfb\u6570\uff08disagreement coefficient\uff09\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "1) \u9996\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709(1+\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u8981\u6c42\u6bcf\u6761\u6839\u5230\u53f6\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7ea7\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u653e\u677e\u5047\u8bbe\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7ea7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u03b5\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff1b4) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u81ea\u7136\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Although the original PED-ANOVA provides a fast and efficient way to estimate HPI within the top-performing regions of the search space, it assumes a fixed, unconditional search space and therefore cannot properly handle conditional hyperparameters. To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes. Experiments show that naive adaptations of existing HPI estimators yield misleading or uninterpretable importance estimates in conditional settings, whereas condPED-ANOVA consistently provides meaningful importances that reflect the underlying conditional structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "condPED-ANOVA\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cbPED-ANOVA\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5047\u8bbe\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u662f\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5373\u67d0\u4e2a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6216\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff09", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u6761\u4ef6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u53d8\u5316", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709HPI\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u800ccondPED-ANOVA\u80fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u6620\u5e95\u5c42\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "conclusion": "condPED-ANOVA\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts.

In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u7f00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\"\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7f55\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u7f00\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u9971\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u867d\u7136\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u505c\u6ede\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u7f00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e0d\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5237\u65b0\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u7f00\u3002", "result": "\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u7f00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7b49\u96be\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u8bb0\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u7f00\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u7565\u6709\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u53f0\u671f\u540e\u5b9e\u73b0\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u7f00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u9971\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66b4\u9732\u6a21\u578b\u4e8e\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8bad\u7ec3\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08RMs\uff09\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Llama\u548cGemma\uff09\u7684RMs\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5bf910\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\"Big Two\"\u5fc3\u7406\u8f74\uff08\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u5171\u878d\u6027\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08Llama\u548cGemma\uff09\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u8ffd\u6eaf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684logits\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002Llama\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\"\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\"\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u800cGemma\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\"\u5171\u878d\u6027\"\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u504f\u597d\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u53d7\u5230\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "PatchFormer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8epatch\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u4e3apatch\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u572824\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u533b\u7597\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1127.3%\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u97006%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u57281000\u4ebf\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5185\u5448\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5904\u7406512\u957f\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u6bd4\u5b8c\u6574\u5e8f\u5217transformer\u5feb3.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PatchFormer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity.

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08ES\uff09\u5728LLM\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u867d\u7136ES\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1GRPO\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4f34\u968f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u800c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08ES\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u7814\u7a76ES\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9ES\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u6570\u65f6\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u4e0eGRPO\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790ES\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u2113\u2082\u8303\u6570\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "ES\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1GRPO\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f34\u968f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5148\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u3002ES\u66f4\u65b0\u6bd4GRPO\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u2113\u2082\u8303\u6570\u5927\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "ES\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u542f\u53d1\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
